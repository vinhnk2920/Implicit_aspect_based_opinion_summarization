I went here twice during the week and can say that I won't be going elsewhere unless I need a full service experience. They've obviously invested in top notch equipment and as a result the wash does a near perfect job. Plus it wasn't busy so you can get in and out quickly  Love everything about this place!!!!    The ease, the friendliness of the staff, the quality of the wash & vacuums.   Such a great concept.   Will definitely come back!!!  So happy I found this place.  So fast too!  What happened to this place? The owner is a good man, treats people fair, as a matter fact I once drop my wallet called an hour later, he found it and waited 30 minutes past closing for me to get back and pick it up! However, recently he seem to have hired a bunch of retards who can't understand the concept of service. But then again, it's $10 bucks & location is prime. I'll go back there, but only in a pinch!  Great place!\nThe facility is very clean, quick and convenient!\nThe staff is also very friendly and helpful!   Grading with a little bit of a curve for the car wash business but overall experience is always pleasant, generally friendly, and I continue to return.  My go-to quick car wash!\nI pass 2 other similarly priced washes to get here and its worth it!\n\nfor starters they hand out candy at the register!\nthe car wash itself does a great job, especially compared to any nearby quick wash places, and of course the vacuums are free. \n\nonce dropped my wallet here, was still there 2 days later with all its contents. \n\nawesome friendly staff! this should be your go to spot!  Pro: Brightly lit, open late\n\nCon:  Waaay overpriced unless you typically drive in the mud and need lots of car washes for a monthly fee",
        "output": "They offer the best service for the price. The owner is a really nice guy who listens to your needs and will take care of any issues you have. Overall a great environment and service you can trust to get your car looking clean and beautiful again."

Came here from out of town and felt like I was at my home shop:) great prices and friendly/funny staff. Victoria is my favorite:) she fixed a situation with the other nail tech because she wasn't filing my nails properly - she did my pedi great though . Anyways I used to go to polished nails and pay too much just because they had a lot of gel color selections I like . BUT now that I've found lovely nails they have all the same beautiful unique colors and it's reasonably priced ! Not to mention I don't really need to make an appointment and the management here solves issues better . My new fav nail place . Been in Vegas 11 years and I've tried many places . This one is great :) I decided to try this place out because its by my house and I saw the reviews on yelp.. I love it! Kim did my acrylics and she did such an amazing job. She was so friendly and talkative...great personality!! Its family owned so it was sweet seeing mom dad and daughter hustling to get all the clients done... I'll definitely be going back Got a full set. Paid extra for gel polish and design. In less than a week 4 of the nails had broken they refused to refund me or fix unless I was willing to wait and pay for it. Lovely Nails is fantastic. We are staying in LV for 2 days and wanted a Mani/Pedi. Spas on the strip are sooo expensive. \n\nWe found this place on Yelp and well worth the taxi trip. \n\nAs for Lily or Victoria. FANTASTIC!\n\nNo need to pay Las Vegas Strip Hotel prices. Come here. \n\nI would recommend and surely comeback. Great service , fast and cheap compare to other salons (. $40 for mani- pedi- eyebrow wax)\nTip was great guy! Will go back  This is a great, family owned place. We called on our way to Vegas and they were able to see both me and my husband same day. Very friendly and great if your on the run.",
        "output": "The service here is hit or miss. Sometimes you get a good tech and they do an awesome job. Sometimes you get one that's not so great and the nails come off or break. There are a large variety of polish colors to choose form an the prices are fairly reasonable. They offer nail services as well as waxing."

This is a great place for groups and because of this, it can be pretty noisy. Love their thin chips and good, spicy salsas. I ordered the street tacos and they were delicious. All of my dining partners were quite satisfied with their meals. Pretty decent prices, too.  Great authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. Free chips and salsa too. Oh and they have delicious margaritas. Very friendly.  We love this place! Our \"date night\" always consist of Margaritas & this is the spot!!!  This was my family's first time visiting and we had an amazing experience! We were warmly greeted and immediately seated by the hostess. Then our AMAZING server Mauricio came and took our order. He was very polite and knowledgeable; he's been working there for 17 years!!! Then Julie, our food expeditor, brought our food and was amazing with my 3-year old... Told him his food was made special for him. I loved the atmosphere and the food was beyond amazing; its very true to the culture and authentic. We have found our new home!\u00c2\u00a1 The average for this place seems about four stars. I concur. The service is pretty good but not extraordinary. The food is satisfying but not great. The price is fair. My gripe is that the food seemed burnt all around. Overall worth going but don't expect anything special. Patio seating is great. Waiters are awesome. Food is middle of the road. It's a good place to go with it being close to my family's home.  Fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share.  Specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren't picky.  It's the go-to place for sit down mexican when we are in town.  The best bar service in the area\n Jose. Rocky. Drew. You rock. Consistently great. Good management.  One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.  Service is consistently good, food is consistently good.  I often order the 3 Amigos.  The carne asada is excellent.  Can't go wrong with this place.  Been here at least 30 times.",
        "output": "The servers are kind and knowledgeable, they will patiently answer your questions. They offer patio seating if you'd prefer to sit outside. The free chips and salsa are always a plus, and the margaritas are amazing too. The menu is full tasty authentic Mexican dishes."

Authentic Phoenix experience squished behind the Starbucks.\n\nPros:\nDecent prices\n$2 mystery shots\nClean bathroom\nA variety of seating options \nFriendly outgoing patrons of all ages  This place rocks. 'Nuff said.\n\nCheap drinks, awesome bar staff, stiff pours.. I love this place.\n\nThey have seen me at my worst, my best and all in between, and no one passes judgement.\n\nSwizzle- stay classy my friend.   The only dive bar in phoenix that truly reminds me of my midwestern roots. Cheap drinks, great happy hour(that's ridiculously long and cheap). You'd think that this would attract the less than desirable crowd to frequent swizzle, but I've only found great bartenders and patrons at this little bar. If you're in the neighborhood you've got to give them a try.   I like the Swizzle stick  as my Dad used to call it.  It's a local bar with no frills except pool table, bar, and friendly people...what more can u ask for?  I'm not a huge bar guy but this place is like Phoenix's Cheers...eventually everyone will know your name.    The sliding glass door with the little beach is what makes this place AWESOME!!!  After TexAz...Swizzle Inn to this Bar  (Wow that was bad!!) for some good times.   After reading such good reviews, decided to check it out. Bartender was friendly and made great shots, but the place was full of regulars who made it impossible to have any fun. Tried to play pool while the regulars were sitting down having a round and got kicked off because they wanted to play. Cute place to get a drink, but not a good place to try to have any fun.   Greatest dive bar ever!\nTheir Christmas decorations rival that of Coach House but without the Scottsdale crowd.  \nYou can find every type of person hanging out here.  \nThe staff is friendly and they pour heavy (but not too heavy). \nMy friend said to me a few months ago, \"I found the greatest dive bar ever you have to go to called the Swizzle Inn!\"  I replied, \"It is the greatest!  I've been going to the Swizz for years.\"  Maybe I should have shared the info sooner?  Love the Swizz!  Reminds me of back home in the Midwest.  Good times and great spot to mingle and meet new people!  Lynn is the reason I continue to come back!! She is personable, fun, and dedicated. Great hire! She makes me feel like I'm at \"home\"!",

The place is very clean and well kept, and the waitress provided superior service with great communication skills.  The restaurant is tucked away, so it's difficult to find.  However, if you follow their address and unit number, you can find it.  I highly recommend this authentic Mexican restaurant!  Hands down one of the best torta spots here in Vegas straight from Mexico City! The bread is good and doesn't crumble like most. Everything is fresh and the shakes and fresh waters are amazing. Definitely coming back to try more food! The place is also very clean and organized. Really good!!!!! Very good food. Atmosphere is nice. Feels like a family run business. Good service. Good food. So glad we yelped and tried it out. Will return when in Las Vegas again. The reviews don't lie! The food is definitely delicious! They had me with the taste like homemade chips and salsa. I had the shrimp tacos which tasted so fresh and so yummy! I def will be back!! It's on Sahara and Decatur by the jack in the box.  Delicious food, good service, and just off the beaten path.  LOVED this place.  The tacos are authentic and well priced.  \nMy favorite tacos are in Tijuana, especially their octopus tacos (they're amazing, highly recommended you add it to your bucket list).  It was a little slower and I noticed octopus as an option on the menu.  I asked if the chef could make some octopus tacos special.  He said he could and they were exactly as I wanted.  So good!  Can't wait to go back.   My friend and wanted to try something new close to work. We came here and boy did we maker a good choice! The food and service was great! We both ordered Pambazo sandwich, it's dipped in enchilada sauce with chorizo, lettuce, sour cream, and potatoes. We both split the sandwich but after eating it.  We wished we would've gotta a full sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious! We both ordered a sopa  chicken and carne asada. The sopas were as big as the plate it came out on. It came with beans, lettuce , cheese, and the meat. We couldn't finish the sopa. I'll definitely be back again to try another dish.   Absolutely amazing Mexican food and people. Cleaner than I expected. I would highly recommend this restaurant, if your looking for a casual place. I swear I do not know anyone hear in this place just stumbled on it.   This place is great!  My kids loved their milkshakes, and I really liked the hibiscus drink.  My husband tried to eat all of the torta... He said it was soooo good but it filled him up :).  We really liked all of the homemade tortillas, and we'll be back!  Waitstaff was delightful.",
        "output": "Oh wow, this place is amazing. Food here is way above what you'd expect. It's not in the biggest area with foot traffic, so it's a bit hidden, but you know what they say, hidden gems are the best. Service was friendly, quick and when they came out with the delicious food, it was overall a great experience. Definitely love this place and you gotta try the tacos, they are delicious."

        "input": "This is a nice little aquarium located right at the flats district. It's the only one of it's kind in Cleveland. As far as aquariums go though, this is not at par with the likes of the New England Aquarium. Think Mandalay Bay hotel aquarium in Las Vegas, which is similar in size.\n\nI echo the sentiments of most reviewers regarding cost and the flats still looking shady. Overall, I think it is an impressive effort, I love it, would love to see it going and would be more than glad to support it.  We had a great time at the Greater Cleveland Aquarium.  The exhibits are well done and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  We visited mid-week when there were smaller crowds.  The Greater Cleveland Aquarium is a nice place to spend a couple of hours in the downtown Cleveland/Flats area.  It is expensive, in my opinion for what is actually there.  It is family friendly, and children enjoy it.  The building is really cool - and sharks are always fascinating,  You can touch a ray, have fish, sharks and rays swim over your head in the tunnels, and also feed the rays - but be mindful of feeding times.  Costumed staff/tour guides add to the charm factor.  The gift shop has a nice assortment of souvenirs.  Love love love! We almost didn't go because it's 20.00 a person and we kept hearing it wasn't worth it, but it was worth it!  The shark tank was amazing! You can walk through a tunnel and they swim right over you. We were taking shark selfies!  They have a really nice touch tank and an amazing jellyfish display.   It's a very relaxing place.  The staff are knowledgable (ask about the poor turtles).   We had a great time today. Even our 8 month old liked it. The wife and I took the family. I expected it to grade out to be an F. The difference in price between a season pass or a day pass(for a family of 5) was $80. Either way, it's not worth it. My kids called it a \"Pet Co. On steroids!\"  the under water tunnel and petting area was cool. Other than that, it is like a pet store you pay $35 to get in to. Factoring in the tunnel and sting ray petting, I give it an overall D!! \nSave you time and money and visit Great Lakes Brewing (down the street)!  Very cool. Went for the Nauti By Nature Yelp Party! Fantastic time!! Love the fishes, sharks, turtles and sting ray petting tank!  I visited during shark weekend, so there were shark-themed activities like sidewalk chalk, pictures, a show and tell guy (shark teeth, sting ray bar, etc).\n\nParking was $5.\n\nThe shark tank is cool and there's a tunnel where you walk through it. Now there are lounge chairs in the petting area. \n\nIt's a small place. I walked through the entire thing in an hour and I probably read like 10 info plates.\n\nIt will be great in a few years, with the expansions. Get the tour!!!! It's not advertised well, but they have a tour for $10 more that is SO awesome. You learn all kinds of stuff that you never would have known, & they take you back behind the scenes. If you don't do the tour, it's your basic mid-level aquarium. Don't miss out!",
        "output": "The staff here are friendly, engaging, and knowledgeable. It's a bit expensive but the exhibits are well done, and there are chances to interact with some of the animals. You can feed the stings rays, and touch them too! The sharks can swim right over the top of you via an overhead tunnel, it's a great view. If you want more informative experience you can pay for a tour."

I believe I found him. Very friendly and informative team. Thanks for everything.  I recommend them. It took a little bit on time to see me but I was in and out with in an hour. They where very nice and double checked it I had any questions. They do electronic prescription, which was very handy by the time I got to my cvs I walked up and picked it up with no problem and in a matter of time.   At first they seemed like an excellent choice, and then I started noticing their dirty billing tricks! A few patients came in demanding a reason why they were being billed twice by the DR. And their insurance company. I didn't believe it! Not until the office tried to do the same to me and stated I'd contact my insurance company to refund me what they were trying to charge. I called my insurer, who stated this was NOT how things worked. My Insurance rep contacted them for a refund for me, and reported them to the board. \n\nThey provided great service but their billing practices are very questionable...read the poor reviews, there's plenty of truth in them.  Stay away from this doctor and don't believe to all of these good reviews. He buys these reviews for $5 Starbucks gift cards. This doctor wants only money and don't care about your health. He is looking for most expensive ways of treatment. He pushed me to surgery trying to get more money from that.\nThanks God, I found another much more professional doctor who can solve my problem without making holes in my belly and  leave scars on my body for the entire live. Fast and easy process! The doctor answers all questions and explains everything to ensure you understand. This was my first time getting an annual exam in over 20 years (I know, I know) the doctor and staff made me feel very comfortable and at ease. Dr. Benitez explained in detail so that I understood what was going on and all the steps we were going to take for my care. I am extremely glad I was referred here and will be going for regular visits now. Thank you, Nicole Clean office with a friendly an inviting environment. The staff is very sweet and organized. Dr. Luis J Lopez was very patient and knowledgeable about all my concerns and questions. This was my first appointment with them and the in-processing paperwork took only a few minutes. I would recommend him to everyone.",

Screw the Strip at $250/per night and extra $25 fridge rental. Here it's all included: vault, fridge in a spacious, quiet room with nice golf course view. There's Starbucks, deli, Fridays, seafood restaurant, bowling, theatre, spa, gym, etc. Best part is it's $60 a night without the strip traffic. I can't justify the higher priced Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio. Rather have that money for dining, shopping, massages and spa treatments. Can't wait for my next trip!  We stayed here for one of our weekend getaways and we loved it. We had a room with a view of the golf course, which turned out to be better than expected. We could see a lot of Las Vegas from our room. The bathroom was big and had a huge walk i shower, but no tub. Overall, definitely worth the stay.   I found the air quality in the casino to be very, very bad. The smell of smoke was overwhelming except near the table games by the valet parking door. Breakfast was tasty and well priced., but the smell of smoke lingered there as well.\nOther casinos in Vegas do it much better. This place is far away from anything, though there is mall going up across the street. \nGiven a choice, I'd 'donate' my money elsewhere.  Worst buffet I've had in a long time. Since I bowl here, I will occasionally have lunch here.  It's usually pretty mediocre. Today we went to practice our bowling, then decided to have lunch. It was the so-called Sunday brunch. It was almost $29 for two. Every dish we tried was cold. The place was busy too. You'd think it would be at least warm with so much turnover.  Very poor management. Not a Fancy Hotel but has a good casino and clean rooms..... and a great price.. I would go again  Rooms are huge! Very clean and comfortable, great views, here for business, highly recommend!  We walked in through here to get to Cafe Sienna.\n\nThe exterior of the building is quite nice and this place is pretty big.\n\nAs soon as you enter the smell of cigarette smoke and the sound of the slot machines hits you.. .ting ting ting ting.. you know you are in Vegas!\n\nThey are open 24/7 - gambling and food!\n\nThe crowd here was much older, enjoying drinks, meals and gambling.\n\nThis wouldn't be my kinda casino to stay it but decent enough.",
        "output": "Hit or miss. It's a casino, so it stinks of smoke.  Buffet is kinda bad and way overpriced for what you get, which isn't that great to begin with.

The price point for a chicken dinner is a little higher than most, especially out in Aurora, but the portions are huge..definitely was enough to be two meals for me.\n\nThe store was very busy with seemingly regular customers coming in for takeout. Omg... I thought pita land was good until I tried this. The portions are ginormous and its AMAZING AND DELICIOUS. It is 100x better than pita land, would get this all the time if it wasn't so far. Like all the reviews have said it.  This place is the best shwarma place I have been to.  Very fast service and the taste of the food is amazing Best shawarma around!  1. Totally worth your money. 2. The owner gives pride on his work. 3. Full filling( Costco size) 4.  Combos are great ( any choice in meat ) frie/salad and a pop. Everything about this place is amazing. Totally recommend  it to all my friends and family and no one is ever disappointed. Best shawarma I have ever  had in the GTA Excellent shawarma and falafel. Huge portions and great flavours. Poutine is big enough for two!  My expectations was  too much  perhaps, I was not satisfied with my meal, Mabe it was one off does nights, will try the shawarma sandwich next time  Best shawarma place north of Lawrence Ave in Scarborough.

Went to tgis Macy's with my friend to look for some shoes. It was the busiest shoe store and it was a mess lol but salespersons were very helpfull. Everyone there was nice and polite BUT Samuel! He was amazing, I didnt have to ask him for a size when he already knew I need a size and asked me first. It just took a look for him to know I needed help. Samuel made my shoe shopping so much easier and fun. I will definitely come back to this Macy's. Great customer service! WAY TO GO SAMUEL and THANK YOU SAMUEL.  I would usually never write a review on a Macy's but I felt compelled to do so because this is far and away the best Macy's I have ever visited. Trust I have been to tons!The salespeople there were so friendly and helpful! They had an amazing selection. The shoe section was out of control busy but the salespeople were working their butts off to be helpful to people.I will go back here next time for sure! I love shopping at Macy's especially the Macy's store at the fashion show mall it's really big and I am always able to find what I am looking for and the staff here is really friendly always going out of there way to help you find what you are looking for and answering other questions and the customer service is great and the store is always clean which is a plus. Terrible service in ladies clothing until the young girl with the red hair rescued me!!! She deserves a 5 Star! The other lady that kept ignoring me while I was waiting should get a minus 5 if possible! This was the Las Vegas location! A big location with plenty of inventory. On this trip we spent most of our time in the women's shoe section. I loved that if you wanted to try on a shoe, they just scanned the code & then someone came out with your size. However, it didn't seem to take any less time than if the floor associate had just gone and gotten them themselves. \n\nI've been to plenty of Macy's that have looked run down and in need of a facelift but this location looked great. There was 1 section that they were redoing, but other than that everything looked as if the store had just opened. A great experience all around.  Early this morning, Macy's Shiseido offered many gift cards and free donuts from the world famous Donut Bar hosted on TV's Food Network and Travel Channel. The store was full. Great security in the parking garage. There were so many people, they needed extra staff to help people park their vehicles. Donuts and coffee, great for starting a last minute shopping rush for the holidays, especially for those families leaving town for the weekend.  im not the biggest macys fan but this one is my favorite!",
        "output": "This place is extremely busy and it leads to some somewhat poor customer service. The staff does wind up working very hard, but ultimately they are just short staffed and need more people to keep up with the volume of customers. The shop is very large though and generally they will have what you want in stock. It can be a fun shopping experience but I just highly recommend that you visit them on a weekday or some other time when they are not that busy."

Ever wonder what live, raw, organic, vegan could taste like?  You will be pleasantly surprised!  Eating here is more than putting food in your mouth and chewing...it is a culinary experience that leaves you elightened both in the belly and in the mind:) As a dairy-intollerant sufferer for many years, this place is my haven!  A place where I am free to choose anything on the menu and indulge in EVERY delectable dessert is truly blissful.  Trust me...once is not enough!   This place is really great you need to experience it for yourself.  Very fresh, very yummy just come in and try it out for yourself....................................\n..................................  I got the pesto lasagna and I personally loved the kale Cesar even more next time I will get the kale Cesar all for myself ! The staff are the sweetest and the ambiance is adorable casual chic good for every occasional what a nice place!! I will definitely go back!  Wow this place is incredible. We had an incredibly tasty healthy dinner. I could not possibly complain about anything. The food was delicious, and it was not heavy and the service was great. I wish I lived in this town, I sure hope they come to So Cal soon!   Excellent vegetarian food makes you realize how tasteful vegetarian dishes are , the falafel sandwich and dishes of all sorts are not to miss , the desserts made from natural ingredients makes u crave for more , I will come back soon   I like their lunch express which includes a soup, a main dish and a small dessert: The Dahl soup is warm and spicy hot. The roll is huge, it's stuffed with lots of vegetables. The eggplant bacon inside the roll is flavourful and so is the nut pate. The roll is served with a fresh salad on the side. Which makes a satisfying and filling meal. Raw food are usually made with a lot of nuts but some dishes on their menu can be requested nut free.  Is it normal to wait for a smoothie for over 15 minutes when there are only 2 tables filled with people in the entire place? Service was super disappointing and no apology was even given after having to have waited so long to get served for takeout. It almost felt as the priority there was given to the staff socializing amongst each other instead of putting customers first. On another note after having waited this long my smoothie was watered down and bitter...I was in a rush so I just left. Other than this the food is always great at your other locations but the attitude needs to be worked on at this specific location.",

This bar is very \"cliquey\" , poor set up- nowhere to stand & gets way too obnoxious on the weekends. Bartenders SUCK - takes forever to be served & they don't know how to make anything.  I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  The buffalo burger was messy and tasty.  It was slightly gamey and slightly tame.  Pretzel bun rocked.  $5 pitcher on a Saturday night?  It don't get much better than this.  At least in Ohio it doesn't... We play trivia here on Tuesdays quite often.  Decent for that, but the food is pretty consistent as well.  Very good Buffalo burger and tacos on taco night.  They usually have a deal going for every week day.  Fairly decent value and pretty good staff.  I know this sounds like a 3 star review, but for what this place is I have to give them the round up.  You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a sports bar with good service and value.  Cool atmosphere, awesome food, and cold beer. \n\nReasonably priced menu and they show UFC fights there if you're into that   The food was good, but the service was minimal. The waitress had a few customers and was doing a favor providing service. She worked on her laptop and from time to time looked around.  My softball team this summer was sponsored by Harry Buffalo.  We always came here after every game and I've always been really happy with their service.  Since they are our sponsor, we get 5 pitchers of FREE beer after every game.  Score!  Additionally their food is excellent if you're into fried greasy deliciousness.  Fried Provolone... helloooo I'm in heaven.  Great wings, cold beer, and friendly staff. What more could you ask for? They have a good fish fry menu as well. If you are looking for a sponsor for your team, the Buff is the place to go.  Can't ask for a better place. Amazing lunches, priced right and lightning fast! Be sure to check them out and they open at 11! Everybody else doesn't open until 11:30!  Highly recommend!",
        "output": "This place is pretty cool!  Its a great sports bar with food that will fill you up completely.  Its nothing fancy, but that's okay because the food is flavorful and delicious.  I had the buffalo burger and could barely move when I was done I was so full!"

        "input": "Such delicious food and decently priced considering you are right on the strip. The Long Beach sushirrito was probably my favorite thing on the menu and it is definitely one of my favorite. Everything is so fresh and tasty and it feels great on your system. It's definitely a must if you are looking for something delicious and fresh.  I liked this place. I thought the service was really good and the food tasted delicious. You can choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl. I got the bowl and asked for half greens and half brown rice. I wasn't a fan of how they made you pick a pre-made poke bowl because it didn't allow you to create your own creation. Also, I felt like my bowl was drenched in too much sauce. Other than that, this place was conveniently located and was an overall great experience.   I have to admit that I am a bit of a Sushi burrito snob. I am a Sushirrito (San Francisco chain) fan. Big fan actually. Though, Jaburrito takes it to ANOTHER LEVEL!   This place was ok. Coming from LA where there are tons of \"sushi burrito\" spots, I thought I'd get something a little bigger and with more flavor. It's a small meal for what you pay for. Nothing special. Might as well be called a poke place. Not worth venturing out for.   After watching the show \"O\" at the Bellagio we stopped in to have a late meal. I had the summer special Acapulco bowl. It had flavor and the jalape\u00c3\u00b1o had a strong kick, washed it down with Asashi beer. It was extremely tasty and satisfying for the sushi crave.  I ordered the Redondo burrito like so many other Yelpers and it was fantastic.  I was watching them make the burritos and they put so much in them that even though it comes out small it is very hearty meal.  I also ordered a side of miso soup which had huge chunks of tofu in it.  The staff was extremely friendly and my food came out fast.  The price was very reasonable and there was a lot of seating both indoors and outdoors.  Can't wait to go back! Unfortunately a restaurant that says it's open until 12a on Fridays but tells people they are closed at 11:56p and turns you away will get a 1 star from me!  \nBad form JaBurritos...bad form indeed!  Sushi burritos are becoming quite the thing in Vegas; between them and poke places, there are an abundance of options around. I've had the item at a few places, and my point of reference is Yoshi Burrito, the first place at which I had the dish. That is, for me, a four out of five star place. This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi. It's not a bad place, and if you're in the area, you certainly can do much worse, but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to get there.",
        "output": "If you are hungry and in need of a sushi burrito spot, this is the place to go.  You can actually choose from a sushi burrito or a poke bowl.  They definitely make sure you are full when you leave because each option is loaded with tons of rice.  Every option is filled with many unique flavors that will have leave the place with a full stomach."

Also, they were affordable. I'll be using them again!   Taurus moving has moved me three times in two years and they have been incredible every time. The men are courteous of your time and your things. As a single girl, they re assured me that all of my belongings would be moved quickly and carefully. \nThey even moved me from Tucson to Phoenix! \n\nI would recommend this moving company to ANYONE because of how trustworthy, quick, courteous, and respectful they are. I will be calling them again very soon :)  We used Taurus Moving last week and loved every minute with there wonderful crew! David was great to talk too on the phone and was very professional.  Corey and his team was very experienced and had a great touch with our furniture.  Very pleased with their work and will use them again when our new house is built!  Used Taurus crew second time to move from apartment to new home.  The Taurus team did a great job moving all of our contents from storage &the apartment.  The care they took was appreciated, especially with an antique bookcase that Taurus moved in pieces and reconstructed perfectly in our new home.  Highly recommend.  Called and left 2 messages without a return phone call.  If this is how they treat you when they're trying to get your business; what will it be like when you give them the job. These guys are amazing. We needed to move quickly when I was unexpectedly put on bedrest at 6 months pregnant. My husband and I moved here about a year before and didn't have friends and family to help out. I purchased a Groupon for Taurus Moving hoping to make the process simpler and could not have been happier with the result. David clearly communicated the process, any additional expenses and even tips to reduce the likelihood of overages. Day of the move, they were on time, friendly and definitely hustled to get the job done as quickly as possible. I would recommend to anyone in need of moving services! UNIMPRESSED. I did an online quote and never heard back.  It has been 5 days.  Very unprofessional. I guess they do not want my business.  A company should not have an online quote system set up if they cannot respond to it in a timely manner.  RIDICULOUS. Booked from 10-12p and confirmed the day before to show up at 10a.  Finally, showed up at 12:30p, so we ended up having to do most of the work ourselves. Previously said that packing materials were included and then attempted to charge (didn't charge, but tried to).  Did an okay job packing, but wrapped valuables in the truck after carrying it outside which is dangerous. Stayed for 1 hour and charged for 2 hours.  They even booked more work while doing my service which means they were not focused on my job.  Overpriced and unreliable.  Will not use again.",
        "output": "Taurus is a pretty good moving company.  I had tons of stuff in my apartment and they helped me get everything out in a couple of hours.  They were a big help.  It was a little annoying that they didn't answer my first online inquiry, but they ended up responding after I called and I'm happy they did."

        "input": "Holy pizza! If you're not visiting Chicago anytime soon then this pizza joint is a must! Hands down best deep dish pizza I've had in the GTA. The crust is cooked well and the right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings is used. I love the garlic sauce drizzle on top! If your heading to mickeys just make sure you call ahead of time to place an order, or else they might be sold out!   Great pizza - both the thin crust and Chicago deep dish. The meat toppings are grilled on site and everything is so fresh. A little more expensive than your average pizza joint but definitely worth it. I've ordered the Chicago style but thin crust with steak, mushroom, onions, with tomato sauce, cheese blend and sirracha drizzle is my favourite. Not open for lunch and hardly any where to sit. Calling ahead to place your order is recommended.   Awesome pizza shop with great employees that greeted us happily and made sure we were helped when we were ready. They have an epic wall full of choices and a fun instructional on how to create an order. We opted for the 'fresh Greek' deep dish and man they went all out on the toppings and the cheese was super stringy without the grease! Overall the food was delicious, super filling so try going in on an empty stomach!  It is definitely a go to place and not a hidden gem anymore (obviously it's too good to be a secret) so be aware that it gets busy and spacing for dining in is limited.  Beats pizza pizza anytime of the day! oh wait, I guess anything beats that place so it's not much of a complliment.\n\nBeen coming back to this place since summer 2011. Amazing pizza( tons of choices), reasonable prices, exeptional service.  This was my first deep dish experience and it did not disappoint. The baby size looks small but it's incredibly filling. This isn't a place I'd hit up regularly, as it's fairly pricey, but I'll definitely be back next time I need to satisfy a craving for deep dish pizza!  They have deep deep dish pizza   just like Chicago    just  closer to home.     They got all the toppings your want.    And cheese fries   that are so   good Amazing pizza. Amazing ingredients. Halal option. Garlic bowl is killer. Probably should not eat from here more than once a year :p  Where do i begin on this!! The deep dish pizza here is AMAZING! I haven't actually had the real thing but this pizza here.... Let me tell you its freaking amazing! The toppings.... the crust.. the sauce and the SIZE! Literally could have died and went to heaven right after eating a slice! I made the mistake of getting a small since I had eaten before, but definitely won't make that mistake again! Make the most custom pizzas and layer that bad boy up with toppings and free sauce... It's almost too good to be true! \n\nThe only downside... It's quite far :( Although I will definitely come back here! Since I LOVE pizza!",
        "output": "I've gotta say, their pizza is absolutely amazing. I can't really fault anything about this place. Their deep dish pizza is awesome. All I can say is that while their pizza sizes, especially deep dish might look small, it does not disappoint on flavor and filling. They really are deep dish. They also have a Halal option which is impressive as far as pizza places. The employees here and friendly and really nice. Service is top notch."

        "input": "I just ate here for the first and last time. I had a gyro and side of rice. when my food was ready I took it outside to eat with my Rotti as the patio is dog friendly. as soon as I looked at my food I knew I made a mistake eating here. there was a long black hair on the top of my food. the gyro meat was paper thin and totally dried out like it had been sliced off hours ago and had a bad greasy taste to it. the rice was odd, yellow and very small grain. it tasted ok so I ate it. I won`t be back !  Everything from the service to the flavors was on point. Initially thought to try it out based on other reviews and was not disappointed. Will certainly be back again :)  Awesome food! very authentic, coming from MI, I've had it all over the place and this is right on par!  Tried their vegetarian falafel and dipitizer (roasted red pepper and jalapeno hummus). Couldn't of had a better combo.  the GF always requests it when im in the area. nice and clean and the owner is really cool and down to earth.   Stopped here yesterday and got take-out. I've eaten at their other location several times and it has seemed like the food has slightly changed over time. Not for the better. I was very disappointed to see a man throw a bag of gray gyro meat chunks on the grill as I walked in. So I guess they don't slice the meat fresh off a spit. My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared. Their hummus was still good but could use a little more garlic or something.  I'll be taking a lengthy break from Pita Cafe.  The jalapeno hummus was very good and a little spicy. The pita chips that came with it were nice and soft and warm. I had the chicken shawarma and the chicken was very delicious as was the sauce. I think this place will do well. Nice small family owned cafe close to  Nothing Bundt Cakes.\n\nWe ordered the Gyro and Chicken Pita which each were $5. Both were very good and tasty. Just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over.\n\nThis is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food.\n\nI liked this place and for $5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza.\n\nWill definitely be back again and try other items from the menu.  Just as awesome as the other location.  I love that this is a family run business.  This location is super clean, and I love that they have so many places to sit.  The food is always top notch, fresh and comes out fast.  Always loved this place... But had a Mediterranean gyro .. Was really bad. Soggy .. Lettuce bad and lots of oil ! The salad was not good either.. Was like it was sitting out for awhile. Not fresh. Bummer !",
        "output": "Like most places, when this first opened it was excellent. Slowly though it has been going downhill and quality has been getting worse. The gyro meat doesn't seem fresh and kind of weird looking. I'd say avoid the gyros because they are pretty bad, but their other food is pretty good. Service is ok too. I was a little disappointed because I expected better from a family run business."

Our group shared the appetizer with cheese and cured meats. I ordered ravioli, so delicious!! I couldn't stop talking about it for days. The portions are on the smaller side, compared to other Italian restaurants, yet even still, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction and a desire to order other dishes ( appetizer, and dessert). \n\nService was excellent , even during a busy  Friday night. \n\nDefinitely will come here again and bring my friends to try it!   A lovely little restaurant. \nFood is slightly above average. \nDid not like their pizzas. \nThey have nice wines. \nCandle light is a nice touch if you are on a dinner date. \nNot great for a group of friends though.   I always find the food reasonable and the atmosphere, lively.  Come by yourself and enjoy your dinner at the bar with a decent selection of by the glass wines.  Food is consistently good quality and well priced though not particularly exciting.  The dining room size is perfect for keeping the space well occupied, creating enough buzz but not feeling cramped.  Staff are usually knowledgeable and well mannered.  Avoid sitting near the kitchen as poor ventilation leads to some smokiness in the air.  Ok for groups.   This is an update to my rave review about the mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Simply, it's no longer on the menu. My next fave is Quattro Stagione.   Pro: good service and not too noise.  \n\nCon: substandard Italian. Veal over cooked. Pasta taste like its out of the box. Bread not worth the calories. Better Italian a few blocks away.  Came here for lunch on a weekday.. had the eggplant parmigiani.. server did not mention it being a sandwich when asked about this dish.. it was under the main dishes so I assumed it would be a main dish.. turned out to be a sandwich with unseasoned fried eggplant some bland sauce and a piece of mozzarella on it.. not worth the 18 dollars I paid for it.. my party the lamb sausage ravioli.. the sauce was watery had no consistency and it was also bland.. I do not recommend this place at all  Not sure why, but I've always viewed this establishment as the next option if Teroni's was too busy.  However, having tried it for the first time last week, Mercatto's is certainly a worthy first option if your looking for casual Italian food.  Service was excellent, decor was beautiful and a great selection of dishes on the menu, something for everyone.  \n\nMust try the iced cuppiccino, could be the be the best in the city.  the mercatto chain is always consistant!!! good food for a reasoable price... much prefer it over terroni... less attitude and more willingness to please... had the magheritta pizza, scallops, clams and fritto misto.... all in for less than $70!!!",

As a plus, they also have good service and the restaurant is pretty consistent in terms of quality and service."

The sandwiches are inexpensive and are, in my opinion, the best Italian subs in AZ. Get the Sicilian if you want to know what a real sub tastes like.\n\nOverall, go to McGurkee's. It'd be impossible to leave disappointed.  Been going here since the late 80s. A family run establishment, creating some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.\n\nFrom the toasted sesame rolls to the pickles and peppers, it's all about the details. My personal favorite is the Super Sicilian.

The food was okay. I'd like to give them more stars, but I could get the same quality at a quiznos or subway. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for a sandwich here, but if your in the area it's acceptable.

It is toasted and has a great taste and firm consistency.\n\nThe restaurant is an older quaint building which is nice and fun. better \n\nOne of the best sandwiches in town.   There is nothing not to like about this place, great sandwiches and a friendly staff of people working behind the counter.  Forget about the chains and give this place a try you willl be glad you did.   It's been a while since I've been in this place, and I figured it was time for a good sammie. I've had a few of their sandwiches in the past, but today I got the Athenian chicken sandwich. The saut\u00c3\u00a9ed onions and feta cheese adds a nice flavor to it. I would recommend this place if you are in the area or for someone who wants to venture out from their usual sandwich joint.",

Great food, great decor, and great service. The best collard greens I have ever had. We had fried oysters for a starter and although I have never had them before so I have nothing to compare them with they were very tasty.   The warm hush puppies with the honey butter was delicious!!  I had the crab legs which were perfect and plentiful. My sister had the all you can eat fried catfish that was also cooked perfectly. A great experience all around!!  Amazing food and great service! The hospitality was out of this world. Will definitely be back soon. The wait was less than 5 minutes at 7pm on a Friday night, amazing!! The staff was very kind and the waitresses were very attentive and helpful. We tried the frog legs, catfish, alligator bites, crab legs, gumbo and of course the hush puppies! Everything was outstanding. What a hidden gem! I love this place the food amazing the staff helpful ....must try green tomatos ...fresh water fish ;^) We love this place the catfish is good the hush puppies with that honey butter are awesome the french fries the gumbo what else is good there the alligator tail mostly everything on the menu. I guess the only bad thing I can say is sometimes it's like a 20 minute wait in the drive-through but it's well worth it when your food is hot Because tonight I got to go home and warm it up it's not hot enough, Even though they're still open for another hour that was a bummer  Really tasty catfish, shrimp and fixin's.  Our friend took us to the sister location on Nellis a couple of months ago, but this location was more convenient to our hotel.  No worries, this place was just as good!  Excellent service, and the salad bar is a nice touch as well.  As a Bostonian, I'm pretty particular about seafood.  The Hush Puppy fits the bill.  Very satisfied!   First Time here and the food, staff was awesome. Manager came over and gave us samples of the fried catfish, super nice.  I never eat catfish. It's nasty to me until I tasted the saltwater catfish!!!

Loved the cheese and thin crust. Price was very reasonable. The owners are really friendly and I look forward to trying the rest of the items on their menu. While I was there a waiter from Grimaldi's stopped in to grab a couple of sandwiches to go. Interesting! The location is about 1/2 a mile north of Shea on 92nd Street, and currently there is road construction hindering traffic, but not too bad. I look forward to trying their homemade Tiramisu!  Really, really, really good! It's a small place tucked in a little strip mall, but we went for an early dinner and were seated right away. We ordered a medium pizza and the spaghetti with meatballs plate and were very happy with our meal. Our new favorite Italian place!  Have come back multiple times often ordering seafood pasta dishes which are always generous and tasty.  Their daily specials are almost always worth ordering.  You need to come here for the food alone. It is so amazing! We ordered pizza, pasta, and salad and everything was perfect. The pizza was BETTER than the ones I had in New York!!! It's a nice little family owned restaurant and the outside seating is beautiful. I would definitely recommend this place. Amazing food!!

We called and spoke with Adam over the phone and negotiated the trade-in/new car pricing.  We drove three hours away to work with this dealership.  Everything we discussed over the phone and text was  exactly the same when we came into the dealership.  When we arrived to the dealership, we dealt with Rick Melara and he was beyond helpful and very pleasant to work with.  These guys were knowledgable, friendly and most importantly... HONEST!!  They have our future business!   This place is terrible. I wish I could give zero stars. Everyone I dealt with was pushy and rude. They wouldn't even let me browse the parking lot until I came in, and listened to a pushy rundown. I am a middle aged woman, and have never been treated so poorly at a business before. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews prior to wasting my time. Please save yourself the trouble, and go to a different Nissan dealership.  March 5, 2015\nAnother 2 calls 10 minutes apart about the 2011 Nissan Juke warranty.  Peoria Nissan gave private information of mine to warranty companies.\nThis car was sold in Sept. 2013.  Aggravation by this company continues to mount, do they realize the error of their ways yet?\nReviews by most people are negative.  Working with Chris, our maintenance coordinator, was great. He kept us well informed on the options available to us, explained exactly what the cost would be for each repair, returned calls promptly, and even took steps to help us get a better price. The mechanics were also great to work with. They explained clearly their rationale, took us back to see the problems ourselves, and never tried to sell us on something we didn't need. The whole team was excellent to work with and we highly recommend them!  I just wanted to commend Internet Sales Manager John Breeser on his professionalism and excellent communication. Peoria Nissan and John in particular went out of there way to accommodate my wife and I on a potential purchase of a new Nissan Juke. He is extremely knowledgeable of the product and he consistently offered solutions to getting a deal done. In this industry I consider John the gold standard. I will refer John and Peoria Nissan to any potential friends/relatives that are looking for a vehicle. Give John a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Would give zero stars if I could.  Went to look at cars for my mom.  Within seconds of pulling into the parking lot we were swarmed by hyena's.  That should have been my sign to get out of there.  They lied about the prices and financing.  If they didn't lie then they are incompetent.  Either way horrible business practice. I had my car in for service while I was at work when I was notified my daughter got hurt at work and was taken to urgent care down my Sky Harbor.  I called my service advisor Chris Rippey and he got the shuttle to come get me and had my car ready and had me out the door ASAP so I could get to urgent care.  I called him the next day to tell him how much I appreciated him expediting everything and he asked how my daughter was.  He was genuine and I appreciated that he cared.  I have had great experience and service in both the sales and service side of Peoria Nissan.  I highly recommend you come here!  Came here as my Girlfriend was trading in her Honda.  The staff and their customer service was awesome.  They met her expectations and beat the offer made by Honda.\n\nGot to hand it to this team!",

Lousy experience and will be looking elsewhere for Indian. This was my second time trying the buffet. They change the buffet menu daily! And it's only $9.99. Everything we tried was delicious. Buttered naan, lollipop chicken, paneer, spicy fried peppers. Service was great. So glad good Indian food has made it to Tremont. Amazing food. Being Indian I can say it's authentic.  The new dessert mango kulfi is out of this world.  The owners go out of there way to accommodate special food restrictions like food without onion and garlic.  Will come again. One of the first Indian restaurants I've been in with a full bar with 2 pages of wine, lots of craft beer (at reasonable prices) and specialty mixed drinks. It's a small, quaint comfortable place with benches and seat cushions (plus regular chairs).  We had 2 martinis- I thought the mango lassi martini was a great idea and tasty! The menu had a great array of vegetarian options as well. Items in blue are chef specials I had a mushroom chef special which was so good.  Would definitely come back.  We went fr the dinner ala carte, nd chose the vegetarian menu fr the nyt.. bad evening maybe, bt the soup nd starters were on a minus note, nd the gravy fr the maincourse wasn't tht great eithr.. hwevr, the naan nd othr bread varieties wer aromatic nd tasted amazing.. Overall, ths place s too pricy, scores fine for the ambience, bt the flavors r jst Ok..! Definitely nt worth the tym nd money spent here..

The appetizer never came out but dinners did. We didn't feel like asking for the appetizer since our entrees came out. We ordered items off the tandoori menu and a curry dish. All delicious. Definitely be going back again!  Poor customer service, overpriced mediocre food. Take your business somewhere to a more friendly restaurant. I wouldn't go other again  Very welcomed addition to Tremont and such friendly staff! Andrei is wonderful and takes the time to get to know his customers by name and remembers our likes and dislikes. The chef was able to beautifully accommodate my nut allergy so I could enjoy the wonderful food!  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!",

I did however really like the wontons in red chili sauce.  Although I am not a big fan of beef noodles, I still wanted to come here and try their other dish. I ordered pig feet (i know, sounds scary) noodle soup.  I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.  The turn over rate is pretty fast, so even if there is a line, i wouldn't think the wait would be too long.   If you are sick of buffets on the strip and feel like some hot (both temperature and spice) beef noodle soup, come and try this place.  The restaurant is really tiny and more of a cafe. The beef stew noodle is so perfect. Not too salty. Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter.  Nom nom nom nom nom. My mouth is watering. I think I'm due for a review too after eating here like everyday in November after discovering. My mom visited in March and we THOUGHT about going here but were sketchy about the cash only policy.  I have seriously missed out since then because i LOVE this place. The first time I came here my mom and I shared the beef noodle soup and the won ton soup. Both were so amazing with lots of fresh cilantro and green onion! \n\nIt's def not a fancy place but this place has super great and flexible hours. I think they are open until 2am on Friday/Saturday. This is the perfect place to go on a chilly Vegas night! The best beef noodle soup that we had so far in the US. We live in California but never thought that we had to come to Vegas to find the beef noodle soup that we've been looking for! Love this place...the best soup...I love those cucumbers...and very friendly stuff ... beef noodle soup and the pork/veggie dumplings are just what the doctor ordered. this 1-2 punch of savory goodness is gonna make your face royal-flushed when the sweet sweet msg kicks in. almost missed my flight out of vegas cuz of this meal but it was still worf it. l'oreal. \n\nthe wifi password to this place is 12345678. is this real life? Zero star .......   They have really bad service... Wrong order, bad attitude, even worse, no apology for their mistake.....  And their food are horrible x 5....I will never ever come here again",
        "output": "This is a decent place to go for Chinese food.  I really like the beef noodle soup.  It has the perfect amount of salt.  i wish the place wasn't so small and stuffy.  I just didn't feel comfortable at all.  Next time I'll just place a to go order."

        "input": "Great service and clean restaurant.   Tonkotsu was excellant.  Nice thick broth and with a little chili oil really hit the spot.  Gyoza was excellent and not overfried like some other places.  Will return!  I recommend the Hachi Special Ramen, the broth was delicious and the noodles cooked just right.  We also tried the Chashu Fried rice which we'll definitely be ordering again.  This place is great! Small place but so good! The chef taught us about Ramen and what he learned from studying ramen in Japan! Really interesting! Definitely coming back!!!  The BEST ramen in Phoenix. They feature tonkotsu, miso and soyu flavored soups and delicious pork in ramen. The owner has trained in Japan before coming to Arizona and the quality rarely sway dramatically compared to other ramen restaurants when the owner is away.   Best ramen I've had in Phoenix for a very long time. Tradition tonkotsu ramen, shoyu, and a fantastic miso broth are on the menu. The goyza is perfect.   Hachi Ramen is delicious! It is just like being at a small ramen shop in Japan. They focus on their broths creating complex and amazing flavors. I have tried two of the ramen flavors, their small plates and desserts and have been floored each time. This is the best ramen in the state and I highly recommend it.   The food here was just ok.  The broth was amazing, but my noodles weren't done right.  Some were cooked perfectly but others were chewy.  Probably will not come back   Tonkatsu ramen is the bomb! No MSG and broth is so good! The pork is melt in your mouth and not too fatty. The egg has a little infusion of soy, ginger marinade that is extra special! Owner talks to customers and takes great pride!  I will be back! I'd take a picture but I ate it too fast!",
        "output": "The Ramen here is absolutely wonderful. As good as saying it might be the best I've had in a long time. They don't add MSG to their broth which is really awesome because some people are sensitive to MSG. Quality is nearly always top notch here. Definitely coming here again."

        "input": "Stayed here for one evening. Check in was smooth and easy! Ben was awesome and very welcoming. He shows interest in each customer he is dealing with! First time visiting Arizona and he had good advice on the area. The hotel was pretty clean only problem was the outside light never tired off later in the evening so it felt like we had a night light. Very refreshing pool. Would return again!  Find yourself a better spot. No receptacle next to the bed for medical equipment.  Toilet must be really old, they're low, like for kids. The phone was broken and they never sent anyone to fix it. Only one hand towel for two people. Cabinet next to sink to hang clothes with no hangers.  One bar of soap for hand sink and shower. You get the idea. The room seemed reasonably clean.   Best value for the money in Scottsdale. Recently renovated rooms look more like something out of Vegas for two-thirds the price of nearby competitors.\nStaff is incredibly accommodating. Stephanie is a closet Victoria's Secret model and a sweetheart. She helped me look through the maid's trash to find a discarded piece of paper (my buddy's fault, not the hotel's). \nAlso, someone may have gotten sick on the sheets and they didn't charge us extra. I'm stopping now.  Staff was friendly and my 1 night stay was without a hitch. The room was clean and the pool was relaxing. I heard Amanda the manager sells crack out of the back office.\n\nBut seriously. Amanda was the most unpleasant, rude hotel staff person I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. Charged $25 for an early check-in then failed to notify us that our room was ready. Woke up our driver to inform him there's an 8 person limit per hotel room. We have 8 people and 2 hotel rooms. When we informed them of their mistake they kicked us all out and called the police. Apparently the police didn't find Amanda's crack stash in the back office (thank me for the tip later Officers!) Great place to stay!! Rooms are big and clean. The linens on the bed were great too!! Stayed here while the Ironman competition was in town and it was still nice and quite. Will definitely stay here again!! This place is noisy and the service is poor. There is never more than one person at the front desk resulting in massive delays. Skip this place - and look elsewhere. Super nice for the price. Have to love getting every penny's worth. Nice lobby and service. Room really plush for $44. Big screen HDTV and king size bed. Comfortable and sleek. Great deal. Will recommend for sure.",
        "output": "So this place is just average. The service is pretty bad and there are some questionable rumors going around. On the plus side, the rooms are pretty good and nice for the price you pay. They have HDTVs too now which is a plus, not some old school CRT TVs. The pool is nice and relaxing."

Both eclair and macaron taste very nice - all flavours are so natural and not overly sweet. The pistachio paste inside the eclair is nicely made. The dark chocolate and sesame flavours are well balance that they won't over power each other. \n\nThe store is very clean and chic; I spent a very nice afternoon there.\n\nAlthough it is an up-scale french bakery, the staff working there are not pretendious; they are very friendly. They recognize I am a new customer and came to check out if everything was good. Service is great!  Really enjoyed this place! New fav spot for macaroons! I'd recommend the salted caramel, red velvet, creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e & hazelnut. They have other exotic flavours like blueberry lavender, lychee raspberry, etc. You can ask for a glass of water and enjoy your treats on their patio. A box of six is $13 approx. And each one is $2.25  This place is a pastry heaven when you walk in. The eclairs, macarons, cakes are absolutely gorgeous looking. \n\nI've had the eclairs and macarons. Eclairs are very good!! The shoe pastry is stuffed full!! I tried their mango passionfruit and it was YUM! Macarons were perfect and a bit cheaper than nadege so I'm definitely going back. \n\nThese pastries make excellent presentable little gifts for family and friends :)   Stopped in just to check it out. The cakes are gorgeous and everything looked yummy. I went home with two macaroons, blueberry lavender and vodka cranberry and I will definitely be going back to try the many other flavours. They were by far the best macaroons I've ever had!  I was quite excited about this place due to the visual presentation of their baked goods. Got 6 macarons and 6 eclairs which were packaged in a nice velvet box. They had some cool flavor combos for the macarons but flavor wise, it fell short. The eclairs were okay, didn't have a crisp bite to it. However, they are presented really well. There are better spots on queen west.  Delysees has got to be the best French bakery/patisserie in Toronto\n\nI have been here twice - first time for macarons and the second time for croissants. They have decent coffee drinks here but the pastries definitely takes the cake (pardon the pun)\n\nReally great tasting macarons - lots of different flavours and priced reasonably. The fresh croissants are like fluffy heavenly pillows - so buttery, flakey and soft. I would eat these daily if I lived closer. Their eclairs look absolutely stunning but I haven't gotten around to them yet.\n\nDefinitely looking to come back to Delysees to try their other offerings!   Beautiful interior, delicious sweets, and luxurious drinks. This is a gorgeous place and the desserts are wonderful! Definitely try the cheesecake, to die for! Also the hot drinks are very nice in this cold weather! The owner/workers are super sweet too and they are passionate about what they do and will help you pick if you cant make a choice!  Love everything!!! Its hard to choose my favourite but if I have too...it will be the gold eclair!!( Its a must try!!) its a dark chocolate with hazelnut yummmmmmyy!!",
        "output": "Wow, where to start with this place? Delicious pastries and food! Yummy cakes, yummy macarons and eclairs. I can tell they care about their food and put all their effort into creating delicious foods. They also have other things like coffee, etc, but I never tried to the coffee. I'm sure it's good though. You can go here and just never run out of things to try, there's so much stuff."

Our crew was great very outgoing and talkative. We just didn't like our instructor john. We lost our camera for a second and we where looking for it when our instructor john told me to shut up and pay attention. Lucky I didn't grab him by his long hair and wooped his old ass and send him to get a perm. But other than that it was great :)  This is an outstanding adventure if you are visiting Phoenix.  Right from the outstanding customer service of Beverly in the office to the ground crew and pilots, this is a first class service.\n\nFor anyone wanting to go I make one recommendation:  do this at the beginning of your Phoenix adventure as it is very dependant on the weather.  We had our adventure rescheduled twice due to high winds and weather.  Do not wait to the last day, you may be disappointed if it is rescheduled.   Highly recommended!!...Hot Air Expeditions company, Captain AL and Kyle made everything perfect for me and my son's (Miguel) first hot air balloon ride. We booked the sunset flight and we were fortunate enough to have the perfect weather and the perfect sunset. We ended up the perfect day with a champagne toast, big smiles in our faces and a great experience that we will forever treasure from this amazing company...  Had a lovely flight this morning with CAPTAIN Al and Crew Chief Seth.  (We were the quiet ones.). It was beautiful and relaxing; the staff was entertaining and skilled. Highly recommended. We had a fabulous experience.  The staff were amazing especially Steven our driver and Mike E our pilot!!!  5 stars for sure!  One of the best vacation adventures ever!!  The staff worked with my disability (not all companies would!!) and went overboard to be sure the experience was safe, fun and memorable! I had no idea how much work went in to launching a balloon. Thank you for the educational and fun adventure!   WOW!  What an amazing expedition that my best friend and I will never forget.  From the moment we arrived until the champagne toast and picnic breakfast at the end we had a very memorable experience.  Captain Mike D was AWESOME!  His experience, knowledge and commentary made the ride enjoyable and our Crew Chief Al was a super human super star.  Thank you for a terrific time!   I went on a balloon ride with Hot Air Expeditions for my birthday and it was an absolutely amazing experience. I really appreciate the staff for being so friendly and helpful. I flew to AZ from Chicago for the experience and it was well worth it. Walter was my pilot and he was great. He had a lot of knowledge of the area and explained the history of what we were flying over and seeing, as well as provided recommendations for other things to do when we landed. The crew provided breakfast and a birthday cake for us which was really sweet. I have nothing bad to say about this I recommend Hot Air Expeditions over the competitors.",
        "output": "Appointments can be rescheduled due to weather, but it's worth it to make the time. They offer a great opportunity for adventure, and will provide a memorable experience. The staff can be hit or miss but are generally knowledgeable and fun to work with. They are willing to work with you on any accommodations you might need. They will also give you some history of the area and recommend you some other activities to do if you're interested."

Tuna, yellowtail and a stripped bass. I'm still waiting for my \"special roll\" and I can't wait. Don't let the outside fool you. This place is legitimate!  We live in the neighborhood and are super happy to have this spot in the hood. We leave ourselves in the hands of the chef and he takes such good care of us. I've tried new things - Saba - Uni- and old favorites. They have a ton of rolls but we've been very happy with sashimi and nigiri. Now they have live music on Friday nights and it's just a nice friendly low key neighborhood spot. Give it a try!  Disclaimer - we went on a Monday night (birthday dinner), which violates my rules of sushi in Phoenix (don't go on Mondays)\n\nWe got a nice assortment of nigiri and maki.  The nigiri was pretty good, and they had some pretty interesting maki, too!  The presentations are very nice.\n\nAlso, for appetizers...Ninja Tears - how can you not?  (Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o popper type things - tasty!)\n\nSome of the folks at the table ordered ramen, etc. too.\n\nVery nice, and we'll have to try it again on a weekend sometime soon   Blue Sushi is fantastic. I used to eat at Pure... not anymore. Just by dining here once, it's evident that decent portions, great service, and excellent food quality are all things that you get at Blu. I wouldn't get sushi anywhere else.  Nothing special here. Daughter and I both had the 6 piece nigiri combo for $20. We stopped by after her volleyball game since the yelp reviews were good and we were close by. The rice fell apart under the nigiri pieces. The fish slices were slim and the quality was the same as Teharu(cheap and easy). The spicy tuna roll that came with the combo was bland and smushy. 40$ later, I'd rather have spent my sushi bucks elsewhere. Plus sides: clean, nice interior, patio. Service was typical.  We can here last Saturday night and had the best experience!! We were greeted by Jinny the owner and had the best service by her!! She truly goes above and beyond. She suggested a winterberry cocktail which was amazing considering I don't drink cocktails. It was made with Tito's vodka and fresh juice, none of that premade mixer crap. Then had the smoked salmon nigiri which was perfect, then the fire blue special roll and the blazing shrimp. Both were amazing but the blazing shrimp was my favorite, spicy but not kill you spicy. All in all we will be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a good sushi place!k   Another awesome meal at Blue Sushi; went to celebrate my daughter's university acceptance.  I don't even look at the menu anymore.  I just talk with the staff and let them choose.  We splurged on the super fresh Bluefin Toro that was spectacular,  The special rolls for the day included a King and I roll that had a spicy Thai finish; super yummy.\n\nThis is now our GOTO sushi joint.   Fresh fish, great prices, and the staff remember you and greet you with a warm smile upon your return. I have been here at least a dozen times and the food never disappoints. My favorites are the sushi tapas section...creative flavors combined with buttery, mouth-watering fish. Yum Yum!",
        "output": "This place makes probably the best sushi in all of Arizona. They give you a good value for your money, but the prices are a bit high. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and willing to help you pick out some sushi that you will love. All of the food comes out fresh, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to try some sushi!"

        "input": "Overpriced Menu $26 for burger.  Ordered margarita and was asked three times on how I'd like it made.   I specified each time the fresh squeezed lime was fine.  They suggested mixing it with lemonade and again, I told them the fresh lime was how I wanted my drink made.   After ten minutes of waiting the drink was finally made and I watched a fellow bartender drink from my drink.  He also allowed a customer sitting at the bar to try the drink.  Then the server took the drinks to us.  At which point we walked out.   Don't waste your time.  There's plenty of other places in the area. Very tall beers and excellent waitress.  Truffle fries are excellent. Maple burger was good but the bun was not good. Too bready. Takes away from the burger deliciousness. Amazing bacon on the maple burger.  Bun just takes too much away. Get a new bun!  I absolutely love this place!  Great atmosphere in the patio, bar and dining areas.  Food is fantastic!  The Lobster roll and Maple burger are my faves!  Not impressed with the menu at all. Burgers and hot dogs? One of our guests wanted vegetarian and the ONLY option was a veggie burger...in 2015!. Wine list is trying to impress with all the high end wines but very little in the mid range and almost nothing from regions other than US France and Italy.  With all the places to eat around here this one is a complete pass.  Nice ambiance, the drink menu is brought to you on an Ipad... COOL.  Loved the mirror that allows diners to see directly into the kitchen, foodies dream.  I had the petite filet and the truffled mac and cheese with the Rioja wine YUM.  The New York Cheesecake was sooo good!  Service was excellent as for Morbina she was awesome.  It is a bit on the pricey side.  Our party scheduled a reservation for news years eve the day before. We originally scheduled it for 6:30 p.m. However, we had a family member playing a hockey game @3:30 on New Year's Eve. We knew we would be late so we called the restaurant and they said we have a 15 min. Grace period. So we arrived at 6:44 (1 min to spare) and they said we lost our reservation and the hostess table was extremely unprofessional and laughing and blaming it on us and was just being straight up rude. However the server was fantastic. After seeing this review we received an email with an apology and we appreciated it greatly. Phenomenal service and tasty food. Ordered the fried chicken sandwich with parmesan truffle fries - both were delicious.  When it first opened I tried their Valentines menu and I was disappointed.  At that time the only thing I liked was the bathroom.  Decided to give it a try two years later and the food was delicious and so were the cocktails.  \nShrimp cocktail - huge shrimp \nRavioli - Good \nLobster Mac and Cheese - Delicious big chunks of lobster \nTuna tartar - Delicious \nThe staff was very nice and polite.  The bathroom this time was very disappointing it did not smell good and was not clean.  Overall I had a better experience the second time.  I will be back in the summer",
        "output": "This restaurant is a little bit overpriced, but when you get something that comes out perfect it's often worth it. The menu options are rather meat heavy and are a bit limited for people that are vegetarians though so keep that in mind. Other than that though they make some great entrees, their cakes that are made in house are fantastic, and the truffle fries are a real treat as well!"

The burgers are jucy but too oily which I don't like. Below my expectations but still worth the try.  Oh my Glob. This is THE burger of Toronto. It's delicious and juicy and fresh, the fries are great, the staff are friendly and don't try to upsell you. They just recommend the House Favourite, the basic \"Holy Chuck\" burger, because it is just DE-Lish.\nWe went today for the boyfriends birthday, and he got the Holy Chuck. I wanted to try something new and got the misunderstood breed. While it was good and interesting, I still recommend the Holy Chuck more. The bacon patty overpowered the freshness of the beef patty so it wasn't as enjoyable.   Our go-to burger place. You can taste the difference in the quality of the meat. It has the most interesting burger combinations and the best shakes of any burger place. And it's not pretentious with it's menu. Highly recommend.\n\nOne tip though: the St Clair location has much better and more amiable service than the Wellesley location.   SO FRIGGIN GOOD, only problem is that they don't let you add or subtract ANYTHING. Other than that, it was so delicious. \n\nBUT! If you're going to get the truffle fries, I would highly recommend you staying away from them. they taste more like PEPERCORN... \"Truffle fries\" shouldn't taste like peppercorn!  Best damn burger I have ever had !!! Can't wait to go back and try the Nutella and sea salt milk shake!  You will definitely not be disappointed.  What's great: Gluten - free bread. Soft. Tender. It sticks together when you bite.\n\nWhat's not great: Makes you feel a bit sick after eating their signature burger. It's pretty fattening, but hey, if you love meat and think it's lame to be on a diet, this could be for you!\n\nService: Friendly and fun.   This burger was AMAZING! I haven't tasted meat this good before. The fries aren't really worth it, but I had the holy chuck and was astounded. Super nice staff too.",
        "output": "This is without a doubt the best burger in Toronto. No one even comes close to having what they have. They have a variety of options to choose from on burgers and have an amazing selection of milkshakes. The Nutella milkshake is an absolute must for any first time visitor here."

        "input": "Sooo good! Their freshly made bread is the perfect pocket for their sandwiches. Have tried both the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken plate. Both were amazing, the chicken is juicy and grilled to perfection with that amazing charcoal taste. My only complaint with the plate is the haphazard salad, literally some iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, dry with no dressing. That with the fact that the eat-in area is very dirty and poorly maintained is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars.  I went there last week, had the kafta-kebab sandwich and it was absolutely STELLAR, good bread and nice, spicy meat. The decor is whatever but for very good, spicy kebab, this is seriously excellent. I will definitely come back!  Meat and bread cooked to order. Spicy chicken sandwich was mouthwatering and tasty. Kabob plate was also good. Unfortunately one person in our party got a bad case of food poisoning. Not sure if we would go back again. I waited a while because there were three people with the same name as me and someone took my spicy chicken sandwich... And I STILL give them 5 stars because it was just that good!! This place literally has the best chicken sandwich I've ever tasted.\n\nThe chicken itself is moist, charred, and flavourful, and really stands out as the star of this establishment in my opinion. Their bread is baked fresh and is just awesome. \n\nIt's sort of a small place so it might get kind of crowded if you're planning on eating there. Take a sandwich (or 2!) to go - trust me, it's worth it. Walked into this place and was greeted with a smile.  The owner was very friendly. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and was not disappointed. The bread was fluffy and fresh and the sandwich was loaded with chicken. I will definitely be coming back here to try the filet mignon sandwich as well. For $6.50 the sandwich is a great deal. The combination of freshly grilled meat with fresh veggies make this sandwich mouth watering. I can't wait to get my next sandwich. Food was good, though I wasn't impressed with the quality of the lamb. The guy operating the cash register was a huge jerk (maybe because I'm a foreigner?) and he rounded down my change to the nearest dollar... Atmosphere was fine, nothing special. It's not super cheap either, about $10 for a sandwich. Go for it if you're a sandwich/kebab fan, otherwise try something else.  The good:\nVery friendly and warm service\nLamb has great flavor\nBread is fluffy and warm and amazing\n\nThe bad:\nLamb was super fatty.  I had to remove half of the meat because it was all gristle and uck.  From all the other positive reviews I'm guessing I just got the blubbery ends, but it's the blubbery ends I got, so else can I review?",
        "output": "The food is amazing, workers are some of the friendliest I've experienced and seemed happy to see me. If I had to leave a complaint it would be that the lamb wasn't the greatest and even a bit fatty. Definitely the place to go if you're looking for a great atmosphere as well as a great sandwich or kebab."

But not bad for the prices. Lost on the shuffle.  Lucky i had extra time.  Ordered soup noodles with beef brisket and tendon.  Normally very fast as everything is already cooked.  They had to ask me about my order 3 times after I asked them to check on it after waiting for 25 mins. When the food finally came, taste was good and portion was pretty big.  Beef tendon and brisket noodle... the tendon was sooo soft and gooey.... mmm.  but I had to deduct a point for the service mishap. and it wasn't busy yet...  Always fantastic food with great prices. I went every weekend for a month in the summer. The owners are always friendly. If you are going later in the evening or late, don't order the tea (milk tea) or coffee. They boil it all day and by then its completely gross. But other wise, I've never had a bad experience here.   Food portions were small and nothing special.\nBonus its its open late.   - solid chinese eats\n- it gives me a good feeling when a restaurant is full of people. and this one normally is. (especially those of the same ethnic background as the cuisine)\n- if ever i have a craving for congee or roasted pork on rice, i'm here. \n- oh and it's mad cheap - which is a nice bonus. i dig healthy competition.   The price point is a little higher than the places I frequent in Richmond Hill/Markham and the selection is smaller, but if I ever craze decent, solid, authentic Chinese food when I'm downtown, I come here!   Initially went to Chinatown to eat beef brisket noodle soup at Kings Noodle but they were closed on Wednesdays. Walked down Dundas and found this spot, decided to try it and as really surprised. The noodles were tasted good, much more generous portions compared to Kings Noodle and they were the same price. Would recommend this place!   This is an awesome place you can go for Chinatown area.Nice service ,delicious food,and what you need more?",
        "output": "Service can be a little slow here. The noodles are really good. I think it's a bit expensive though for what you get.

To bad I don't drink! The margaritas looked delicious as well. Will be back when I visit Arizona again!! One of our favorite places...well used to be but now you can't park anywhere.

I always get the same dish every time. Enchiladas!! That is my go to food always! No complaints ;)  The food is always hot, fresh & yummy. Big portions. We LOVE the chips and salsa. Atmosphere is great and staff is friendly.  Nandos is a nice place to go for a meal. The service was excellent. The portions were large. The fajitas my wife had were excellent. The Mexican pizza was very good. The chips and salsa were great. My meal was good not great. The rice was very average. The cheese on my meal was more of a Colby jack as opposed to a nice white Mexican cheese. The atmosphere was very pleasant and the place was hopping on a Friday night. I would go back. The atmosphere is warm and inviting but the food here is lackluster. Bland salsa and tasteless chips to start.  We had the special: tilapia fish tacos. Mushy fish and greasy corn tortillas.

The ambience, employees, menu and quality of the food is all above par and worthy of your visitation.  Late night went for apps. Calamari and meat balls had been recommended by server ...tried both. Both good. Service was friendly and good. Great patio, great menu, and absolutely great servers too.\nJamie was absolutely amazing he's a 5 star server! Awesome place I love the hot wings however it would be better if there were more choices for wings I thinks I would be happier and a lot of other people would be. The food is more like 3* not bad for a fancy bar but nothing that makes you want to come back. But the place is noisy, even at 1:30pm with distorted music in the background. The kicker though is that for 7 of us we were told they would automatically apply 18% gratuity... So the server could not care less. We had to ask for waters, for drink refills and overall she was as unfriendly as it gets. Why bother earning your tip if you know you are getting 18% no matter what. So not really recommended.  Awesome menu, great atmosphere and tremendous service....\n\nLively crowd and overall very FUN and ENERGETIC environment \n\nBest restaurant in Oakville for sure  Good Ambience. Young vibe. Helpful Staff. Food was Good. Expensive place. \nI ordered I don't remember the exact name of the dish but it was a Chicken curry which comes with some rice which was good. They have a decent cocktail menu. We were a group of 6 people and out of all the cocktails/wines that we ordered, the biggest serving was of \"yacht club\" cocktail. So, If you want a value for money, generous quantity cocktail, order the vodka based \"yacht club\" cocktail. A regular here for drinks and small bites. It's always packed here so it has great energy. The food is pretty good including the calamari and the meat ball app. The burgers are also very good!",

The food is fantastic!  This is our third visit and the food continues to amaze. The best Mexican Food we have had. All this located in a small strip mall located on Carefree Highway just off of I-17. I can't recommend this place enough. Very colorful place. Excellent service and the food is delicious. All the dishes are well made and very tasty. The prices are also very reasonable. Definitely worth the visit.  The restaurant is cozy, clean and colorfully decorated. The margaritas were good and the food is typical Americanized Mexican. Great for families and kids as the bar area is tiny.   This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant around us. The service is top shelf, just like their delicious margs. The food never disappoints. Seriously every time I try something new, it becomes my favorite thing to get. The staff treats you like family, and it is always a pleasant experience every time we go  Great food and wait staff was very happy and friendly good value happy hour deals pretty good as well I love Plaza Bonita!! I eat there nearly once a week. I recommend Camerones Mexicanos and a Cadillac Margarita.  Possibly the most efficient service that I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant.\n\n\nReally cute car and brightly painted chairs and tables. Very bright Decore.\n\nFood is right on   Good was very good, excellent fast service and the margaritas are great. \nHad the chef salad, healthy option and my husband had the beef fajitas which were very good.",

If you love the desserts in Studio B Buffet in the M Hotel but don't want to wait in the massive buffet line or even eat in the buffet, Baby Cakes in the M Hotel is really nice fix.  With their yummy gelatos and mini cakes, one must have a really good reason not to step into this place.  Mini desserts for $1.50 really cannot be beat!  Well, actually, the only good reason that I can think of is that you are eating at Studio B Buffet.  BUT other than that, there isn't one good reason for me to not visit this fabulous establishment for a bit of sweetness if you are in M Hotel anyways.  No excuses! Yum! Awesome!!!!! Had the white on white cupcake red velvet cupcake and strawberry cheesecake all three was fire lol will definitely go back oh yeah they have great brewed coffee  I live close by and I love going here every chance I can get. I usually get milkshake or a fruit tart because those are my favorite things here.n\nBut basically everything I've tried here is really wonderful and I recommend going if you're up for a little snack or something sweet.   Checked into M resort and was starving...thankfully I walked around and went into this cute little bakery.  I was drawn to the Cronuts and wanted the cinnamon one...the lady behind the counter suggested the chocolate one, so I got both.  OMG, it was delish!. It was a nice size and the flavor was dang good.  I did prefer the chocolate one over the cinnamon one.  I later tried the pumpkin bread they have seasonal, its in slices--soo moist and yummy!  Try this little bakery if ur at M...soo delicious!   I LOVE PASTRIES.  That being said, the latte was pretty good.  I feel like I should have gotten one of everything but in a rush to get to the airport I ordered a chocolate croissant.  Although tasty, I prefer the chocolate to be consistent throughout the entire pastry, not just a clump in the middle.  I wish yelp let you review restaurants in European cities because the Chocolate Pistachio croissant at La Durree in Paris is the closest the to heaven I've ever tasted.  It's worth a trip to Paris just to have a treat and cafe creme at La Durree.  Is it possible to walk by this spot in the M Resort and not immediately start salivating? No, it's really not possible. So much dessert goodness!\n\nI always stop and stare at the glass case and contemplate what I am craving the most. And all of the desserts look so pretty and well put together.\n\nBut, in the end, 98% of the time, I just go for the gelato. And it is some really great gelato. Hint: Go for two scoops and choose two different flavors that compliment each other. Personally, the mix of coconut and chocolate chip is a fav. This guest review is written by Claire, my inner fat girl.\n\nME WANT FOOD! ME LOVE BABY CAKES. \n\nIndividual sized desserts are perfect for eating three to five at a time. Baguettes should be bought two at a time because the first one is unlikely to survive the 10-minute drive home. Apropos of nothing, Jay needs to start keeping European butter in the glove compartment.\n\nSo don't just sit there. Carb me.\n\nI SAID CARB ME.",
        "output": "Wow, where to start? Some of the best sweet foods I've ever had. I wasn't sure what to try, so I tried a few things, and oh my goodness they were delicious. That's not all though, they serve drinks too so I got a latte and that was good too. There is a lot of variety here to choose from that'll make any sweet tooth salivate. Definitely a good place!"

I had a few old pieces that I no longer wear, and I brought them in to the shop and they gave me a great price for my jewelry.  I thought they were really fair after being several places.  Now I can buy something that I will wear.  Sold my Rolex and diamond pinky ring. Time to get rid of the old and in with the new. They treated me like I was family and got paid more than expected.

We were looking for it, not realizing it was a restaurant converted from a house. And when you get inside it's super cramped. But once you taste the food you will fall in love.\nI had the carnitas. Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun.\nWas good food and fun. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area.  There are limited # of restaurants in the area , this place was decent. The restaurant ambiance is small and cozy. Seats about maybe ~20 people, our group took up 1/3 of the seating area. \n\nRecommend ordering the guacamole, the chips are very delicious.\n\nI came here with a group of 8, we ordered a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed it. I got the lamb, the meat was tender and well seasoned. \n\nOrdered the hibiscus juice made in house, it was too sour. \n\nFood quality: 3.5/5\nService : 4/5\nPrice : 3.5/5  Very nice staff, really cute place. Food looks nice and is not bad. It just doesn't taste like Mexican food. The ingredients are there, but the nuance of cooking, maybe how they roast their chilis and the combination of spices, doesn't taste authentic. The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense. I want my chip to be light, crisp and thin. Crunch, gone.   One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! Family style servings and food tastes legit.\nThe deconstructed tacos are a great way to share with the family. We've been here a few times and it never disappoints. It gets quite busy for dinner, make sure to make early reservations. \n\nOne tip, try the ceviche campechano.  We had pork carnitas (excellent) and lamb tacos (good). Solid service but felt overpriced and probably wont go back. Yum yum yum!!! Popped in here today for lunch. We had the whole place to ourselves because it was a Sunday and early. To begin with, the place is super cute! Absolutely love the decor. We started with the guacamole which was good. For my main, I had the beef brisket in salsa verde. It was flavourful and plentiful. I tried a bite of the carnitas too and it was so tasty. Will have that and the ceviche next time. Our server was so cute and very personable. I wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out because he was lovely. My lunch with one beer came to $35. I feel it was worth every penny. Highly recommend!  Good Mexican food in Toronto?  At Cocina Economica, the answer is an enthusiastic YES.  I pretty much had their entire menu, and all the dishes were quite good.  All the meats are served with rice, beans, corn tortillas and homemade (spicy) salsas.  The stand out dish for me was the Carnitas - falling off the bone.  I really enjoyed the vibe of this place.   Top notch stuff.\n\nSucculent meats (we had the braised beef shoulder and the pork belly) with all the fixings for more-than-you-can-reasonably-eat tacos (the dishes come with tortillas, beans, rice, and salsas for flavor). The flavor and cooking was on point; guac was also noms.\n\nThe decor was sweet and they had a nice (slightly hipster) vibe going on. Service was friendly. Unfortunately didn't try the drinks this time but they seemed promising.\n\nOverall, a great food-preggers-inducing experience. Looking forward to returning to my new favorite Mexican place ;)",

The IPA is really good but my wife says they need orange slices for their wheat beer.  All the bar tenders are very friendly and helpful. An added bonus is being able to order food from restaurants nearby and bring it into brewery. A must try in Gilbert. It was great to see Jaye. Their place is amazing! We love local IPA craft beer and theirs is up with the best in the valley. We had a flight(6) plus an extra (they were already sold out of 3 since opening day on tue!) the three that were memorable to us were Frontside which is their west coast IPA and it was a smooth citrus hop. Midnight run which was not as sweet as your typical coffee stout but still had a hit of chocolate. The Mijo was amazing it's a triple IPA (10.4 abv) and you could really taste the peach and mango flavors. I wish them all the best this place is great! Probably 4 1/2!

When I asked again the waitress gave me attitude that she'd \"have to go upstairs to get it\" as if I didn't ask for it once already.  If you don't wanna hear my drink order, don't ask for it.

Its a more upscale pub in a beautiful old house with a large patio upfront. The service was welcoming and great throughout our night and the food was surprisingly good for pub food.

I wish there was a few more vegtables at the salad bar and had more crouton options. \n\nI will have to head back to try the sandwiches.   The California Club is life. I've loved Jason's Deli from afar for too long and am pretty sure it's time to come home...if only I could afford it regularly.

Love the food but don't care much for the price to quantity of food ratio. This does not speak for the food however, it's delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful! Will recommend to my richer friends.   Maybe not the most filling sammmmich I've ever had... but good. It always is. I went there late a night and sat by myself (sad, I know) and just played scrabble on my phone. Maybe someone from Yelp will come keep me company next time!

One guy behind me got the same thing I did (just a larger version) and got his before I did. And when I finally got my potato, it barely had any toppings on it. Really dry. Not tasty. Saving grace is the free ice cream you get.  Great place to eat. Food always taste fresh. Frequently visit ray road location. Ice machine always seems to be broke. Kind of unsanitary to scoop ice with scooper laying in the ice. I stopped by here for a quick bite to eat.  I got the club sandwich minus the tomatoes and a cup of chili.  The food was really good.

Felt that sales were really pushed on me and the price ended up being substantially higher than what I was quoted. The owner seems to be proactive in fixing issues so I've updated this post a little. Hopefully proper changes have been made.  Hands down my best haircuts and colors have been by the amazzzzing Amanda Fuller. She takes her time to understand exactly what I want and even though I'm terrible at explaining ... She reads my mind and gets it right every time! I've since moved to San Diego but can't wait to come back to Vegas and get my locks rocked by Amanda! Liana is the absolute best! I am a professional who has to pull of an on camera look that says I am responsible and professional yet I also want to have an edgy look in my free time. Liana gives me the best of both. She really listens and gives great feedback. I always feel like a new woman after leaving her chair! She's fun to chat with too which is just a plus.  Decided to try this place out after searching yelp. I was hesitant with my thin, fine dark hair, as I always am. I went to Megan. She was sweet & easy to talk to. Honestly I was unsure of my hair that first day, but now I love it. The cut is great for my fine hair, I have tons of volume. And the color is nice & natural like I wanted. I got a partial bayalage\nAnd really like how it turned out. I think going from black to some lighter color was a shock, but it's perfect for summer around the corner. Thx Megan!   Second time with Skaught and all I can say is AMAZING. Fantastic listener and even better stylist. He really tries to understand the look you're going and gives you what you expect. For anyone in the Vegas valley: stop wasting your time and money, Skaught is the best in town!",
        "output": "The stylist I had was really attentive to my needs and desires, and listened to me. I was really happy with the whole experience, and while a tiny bit pushy, I can understand since they do want the best for you. This is one of those places where you come in, and you leave really happy, and keep coming back. I sure will."

        "input": "so I was suggest to try this place out by my sister the other day and finally had time to make it over for lunch\n\nI wasn't too hungry so I just got a couple appetizers. got the chicken salad and a takoyaki. both were really good. the service was good and the place was clean and the music was good. \n\ni'll be back again to try a ramen sometime soon! i'll leave an update when I do   So excited to have a ramen place in the NW. We have been back a few times. \n\nPros: good portion sizes, friendly service, great tasting ramen, clean interior, cool that they have outlets to charge your phone \n\nCons: prices are a little steep, no options for kids' portions or pricing, no delivery yet\n\nAll in all, a good experience at this place and a nice option for ramen if we don't feel like heading to Chinatown.  Mediocre ramen with terrible service. They harass you for the first 5 minutes of sitting down then pretend you don't exist for the next 40. If you need anything from the waitstaff during your meal you're out of luck. Took 30 minutes just to get the check to leave. Okay ramen and nice to have something on this side of town but won't be coming back due to terrible service. 3 of us tried 3 different ramens and all were very good! The crunch roll and green salads were really good as well. We will definitely be back! Great Customer service! Food was good and fast too. Only con is that the floor is a little slippery. So I've have eaten here twice since it opened a couple of weeks ago the first time I thought the Ramen was pretty good the broth had good flavor the fried octopus balls were also pretty good, however today the Ramen broth could have been salty dish water it was hard to tell. Having worked in F&B  for the last 25 years it's hard to sit down in a restaurants and give an unbiased opinion on any amount of money that I am spending for a meal good or bad. This is also the only place for Ramen in a 10 mile radius so we will keep coming back for now. Also I noticed the \"Owners\" sitting at the back table counting their money I thought that was very tacky get an office. Super delicious food. Their signature sushi roll is to die for. The staff are very nice. Will be back again.  The Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen was out of this world good! So was the Cashu fried rice I would recommend getting a more traditional Genmaicha  green tea though... \n\nThe Brussel sprouts sounded  good but were  bland.\nWe will be going back many times for sure!",
        "output": "I never knew ramen could be the kind of food I would go out to a restaurant and enjoy!  This place changed my mind!  There are many different ramen dishes to choose from.  There are also many other options such as octopus rolls and sushi.  If you're looking for something different, this is the place to go.  The only improvement I can think of is that the service could be better."

Our server Tiffany really did amazing work with recommendations, attentiveness, and explaining the fondue process in a relatable way. We came in with some anxiety, but she really helped us relax and enjoy ourselves even as first-timers. Will definitely be back.  My wife and I where in Charlotte for our anniversary and had a fantastic time!  We had the four course meal.  Our server was great and very knowledgable about the menu.  Food was great it was a neat experience cooking our own food.  We would definitely return to The Melting Pot! If you like boiling steak, be my guest.  It was labeled filet on the menu but it may have been London broil.  The only reason to go here if you are a sap and are trying to impress your girl.  The cheese fondue I understand.  The dessert was good.  Ask for the bananas foster.  Will run over 40 a person not including drinks.  I rather have a chef make my meal than myself with a hot plate. OMG!!!! Best place EVER!!! I go there every year for my birthday. I love how many they options that they have. Also the dessert is AMAZING!!!!!  Great food, experience and service. The staff really makes a special occasion even nicer!  Amanda or waitress was wonderful! She explained all the options and specials with flare and was super helpful with substituting some of the options bc my fiance is a vegetarian. This was a wonderful 1st experience at the Melting Pot! I made a reservation for my 1st anniversary. I was so disappointed when they brought my dessert plate to the table. It was simple it didn't have written letters saying HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.. I was expecting something better since it was our special night. However, I called the location twice to confirmed they had everything I requested. I don't recommend people to go there for special occasions...\nI would give \n1  for the hostess /managers \n4  stars for the server because it was not his fault about the dessert plate.. it was for the people that made \nmy reservation..  We go every year for our anniversary!  Always a special romantic meal to be remembered.  We ordered the big night out with the artisanal charcuterie which the waiter forgot until we had eaten the cheese course so we got extra cheese! Yay! We did the Swiss Gruyere and it was awesome.  The seasoning blend they have to sprinkle on the salad is great, I have bought bottles of this as stocking stuffers before.  We had herb encrusted chicken, pacific shrimp, sirloin and filet.  For dessert we had the chocolate and dulce de leche fondue.",
        "output": "The restaurant has good food and the staff is really helpful and friendly. If you need it, they'll take their time to explain options in depth. So if there are vegetarians in your life, the staff will also go over the options available for them and they're really knowledgeable about what's on offer! Really good experiences at this restaurant."

It was a bit of a pain to have to ask what was in everything as there were no tiny signs with ingredients/descriptions that I saw.   The sausage rolls here are amazing and a great value.  I cant wait to eat through the pie menu.  So far ive had the meat and curry chicken, flaky buttery crust and very tasty inside.  A great addition to old town Scottsdale.   This cafe/ bakery is an amazing place. My wife and I were visiting from California and found this local gem. The women behind the counter were so nice and the drinks and \"pasties\" were delicious! Highly recommend this placed!   Family visited Scottsdale this past weekend. Stopped for a quick snack, great tasting pies, awesome desserts. Super friendly staff. A must if you're in the area.  Wow, the chicken artichoke pot pie was unexpectedly delicious - hot, flaky, savory!!! We loved it. We were not sure what to expect so we picked 1 \"safe\" item - bacon quiche pie. It was also very tasty and super satisfying. But, I wish we would have picked one of the more unique flavors. I could see coming back everytime we visit the area. Great friendly service too. Loved it!  Was fantastic, had the chicken avocado pie and the sausage roll.  Service was good too, friendly staff. Flavor was amazing, will definitely come back for some Bundaberg rum when they get the bar put in.  It possibly is the best coffee in scottsdale.  The spinach feta quiche and apple turn over are amazing.  My daughters iced caramel latte was very good.  Highly recommended.  This place is a must-do in Scottsdale! We are locals from Tempe and came to try their food and pasties. Our expectations were surpassed with a delicious sausage roll, chicken avocado pie, and others! The Lamington dessert and apple turnover were perfectly made and I ate the rest of it! \n\nThe owner is so cordial and the staff was just as good. The owner came over to our table and put a small town home feel. We will definitely be coming back!",
        "output": "These people have amazing pies and pastries. You can tell they know what they are doing and have a lot of experience. The taste is really nice and they also have good drinks to choose from. It was busy here but service was quick and fast, so not really a slow down in busy hours. I'm sure in slower hours it'd be even faster. Nice little gem here."

The sushi was excellent (Salmon Roll and Dragon Roll), but the beer selection was limited.  I shaved off one star due to the fact that it does not have any beers on tap.  The sea bass is one of the tastiest meals i've ever had in my life.  Just got done eating here and I got to say I like it!!!! The food is very good especially the oysters, the three sauces it comes with are good but when you combine them its fantastic. The sushi rolls are all unique in their own way. The best roll there is the sumthin sumthin roll.  I'll be eating here again since I got pretty much the whole meal comp'd.   Hachi has a great happy hour. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. \nThe food was delicious, the coconut soup was yum! The service was excellent and the happy hour prices were great!  Atmosphere and decore is fantastic. \n\nLychee martini is five star and at 12$ it's not supernovae priced. \n\nThe beans are a must order \n\nThe kimbucha soup was good\n\nThe mushroom salad was below average\nas well as our tofu rice noodle large dish,  especially for 18$.\n\nI believe that there are better restaurants at Red rock. This place is adorable! I love the decor and ambiance!!  They have private rooms in the very front of the restaurant (unfortunately facing the parking lot!!) but they are beautiful!! The happy hour (at the bar only) from 5 - 7 pm is awesome.. they have bottomless mimosas for $8! \n\nThe rolls are great, averagely priced sushi for the location... You'd think Red Rock would be charging $15 minimum per roll, but no.. You can get a roll for $8 - $11 just like everywhere else.  Great place for a first date!  Excellent sushi, excellent cooked food.  I really loved the seared tuna with foie gras.  The lamb chops were incredible.  Really love this place.  If you gamble, you can pay with your points...fantastic!  The quality of the fish here is above par! The high drink prices however make me take away one star. We were in a large group and sampled many different rolls and appetizers. I really liked the tempura items and we didn't have one dish that wasn't well liked. The rolls with Hamachi were my faves!",

A little bit pricey but taste of food deserve it.   Being from the east coast, I always worry about getting fish in the midwest but I am going to hand it to Sakanaya, the Chirashi I had was absolutely delicious. The fish was wonderful, fresh even and with good variety of fishes. I loved the decor and the ambiance, very relaxing. The portions are good, though if you're on a budget this might not be the place for you. Definitely worth getting again.   One of the best and nicest restaurant on campus. The ramen and bento are very delicious and enough to fill you up. I would recommend to go with your friends and families, really! Also the wings are good for late night. So, don't forget to order them when you go eat at late night.   my second time trying sushi, delish!  Best sushi place around and probably the best service I've had in a long time. Went with two buddies of mine and we had about a 5 minute wait in a packed house and received our food well within 10 minutes. Refills on water were done before we even had time to look up and they were extremely helpful about making our experience worthy.  Ramen was off the charts and the sushi was fresh!  Came here based on Yelp reviews and did not disappoint. Willis tower is interesting, nice presentation and a great mix of flavors and textures, a must try! The rolls are also very good. Sashimi is fresh , will visit again!   the willis tower is very delicious, and the I love salmon combo is to die for. the sashimi melts in your mouth  I've been all over our country and had sushi at all levels and I'm not sure if these college kids just haven't had sushi or what?\n\nThis is nothing fancy. Flat tap water on every table. Your standard miso soup. \n\n$17 for a lunch special got me maybe 3-4 ounces of meat and one roll that was pretty good but fried and prepared earlier. Usually sashimi is at least served over beds of rice for a little more fill. \n\nThe wasabi is very weak. Rice is kind of dry, I've had fuller rice.",

They seemed to have straightened out their ordering system, and the food has always been high quality. Great fresh food.   Great place!!!! Always clean, food is always fresh. Perfect for lunch or a quick bite. Parking could be better but we did discover you can park behind the building and there is a walkway close by for a shortcut!  Gluten free grilled steak wrap today for lunch was amazing! Quinoa salad, green #4 juice! I LOVE this place, service & food excellent!  I really love their juice, but they've really gone down hill from when I first started getting them. They've gone up in price and don't even fill up your cup - waste of money. I'd rather go to Nekter or anywhere else to get a juice.  This place has HORRIBLE customer service and it's not even close to being worth the price - do yourself a favor and go somewhere else  Very cool atmosphere although it was extremely crowded for a Tuesday morning...hate to see what Saturday looks like. Got the Thai protein bowl. Had overall really good flavor and the forbidden rice was delicious! Also got the slim juice and it too was delicious! I like the Scottsdale location better in terms of service but both locations have the same food choices.\nClean, healthy foods. You can choose between salads, smoothie bowls, sandwiches, and brown rice / quinoa bowls. For drinks you can get fresh juices, smoothies, coffee drinks, tea. \nFood is usually prepared quick. \n\nI personally like the Power Green or the Immune boost for juices, the Tofu rice bowl (comes with a bunch of veggies!), and the Beet salad. \n\nI come here every Thursday between 2-3pm and there's never a long wait :)  This is my favorite OG Chop Shop location. When I stopped in it was pretty dead, not one person in the store so I was a little nervous eating here. All the other chop shops are always super packed. Orders my usual protein bowl with grilled steak and it was delicious. Lemonade was good too.",

Chris drove the car until the issue showed up and quickly diagnosed the problem. I will not go anywhere else.   I bought my first car over the weekend from Andrew. It was a very professional and awarding experience. Even after the sale, I can tell that Andrew will be there if I need anything or have questions. He was always straight up and eager to help with any questions or concerns. I would highly recommend you to see Andrew if you are looking to purchase a vehicle!  What a first class experience at this North Scottsdale Benz Dealer. Joe Palmisano is a longtime experienced pro who knows how to put a car deal together. Why spend a whole day buying a car when it can be done quick and  fast to be down the road with no hassle. Joe followed up as promised on the will bill. The delivery was was beyond expectation with tech follow up. Would also like to point out Dana Rae Miller in F & I who got us in and out the door with every option covered.  My husband & I had a wonderful experience at Schumacher Scottsdale, Not only was the dealership and vehicle line above our expectations but our sales person, Deanna Hanna, was very knowledgeable and patient while helping us narrow down our decisions. She had excellent customer service and we will definately be back to purchase our new car when our finances are in order. Thanks Schumacher & Deanna  For about 20 years I have been dealing with Schumacher Mercedes and specifically Remington Logue in sales. Remington always exceeds my expectations. Just a great dealership. Great sales people and great service advisors. \nIn my case, Mike Stoops always looks to assure the cars are in perfect condition and most importantly safe. I always feel welcomed at Schumacher. They make you feel like a VIP! Everyone I work with has been awesome.  Very nice dealership. The people are helpful.  I have owned Mercedes in the past and now own a Lexus.  Mercedes is expensive to repair and if the car is older it becomes economically infeasible to own.  Not to mention the have a customer area that you pay for drinks, snacks, and coffee.  All Beverages, snacks, and sandwiches are complimentary at Lexus.  Mercedes do not hold their value to expensive!!   Michael, Chris & Mr. Schumacher himself are so kind and hospitable. When Right Honda screwed me over ROYALLY, the good guys at Schumacher walked me through the steps of reversing a car sale they made with me to ensure I didn't get manipulated any further. Lou is the greatest salesman. No pressure and concerned with the needs of the customer. Tracy at the Starbucks coffee shop keeps you pleasurable company while you wait and most of the products if her shop are complimentary! This dealership emits such a warm environment.",

But they don't honor Veteran's or seniors......that's ashame......cross this place off my list! Always make sure to have them repeat your order in the drive thru. They always mess up my order and I end up having to drive back to get it replaced. How do they stay in business like this?  Every time I come here and go to the drive thru, they screw up my order. They took so long to answer, I almost drove up to see if they were open. I'm just going to spend the extra money and go to Starbucks. At least they pretend to care even when they are slammed & get my order right. Yeah, you get what you pay for, but I'm still paying & should get what I ordered.   This is probably worst Dunkin Donuts I ever ate \nThe donuts was small and old (disgusting)\nI don't recommend this location  Decent doughnut shop. I usually just get a regular glazed doughnut and an iced coffee. Don't expect anything amazing or spectacular when you come here. There's usually a line in the morning so if you're running tight on time, I'd pass. The wait time is a hit or miss. I've waited 5 minutes for a cup of coffee, and other times they had it ready by the time I got to the window.  This is a great dunkin donuts location! We did the drive through and it was very fast service. The woman helping us wasn't in the best of moods but she gave us a smile as we paid. \n\nI would recommend coming to this location if you're in a rush and need to use the drive through.  This location is minutes from our house. Unfortunately, the donuts here are always so dry! Not really stale, but dry donuts. It's sad that I can get better and cheaper donuts at Smith's or Vons. The staff working the counter were extremely friendly! Only reason why I'm giving 3 stars. I keep hearing in general the donuts at Dunkin' are not that good. Maybe they should change the recipe. I will not be back.",

Really tasty.\n\nInexpensive, tasty and lively - in Montreal's somewhat small Chinatown. Worth a visit if you are craving Ramen, and I was.!   Awesome ramen soups!

Its a really nice spot for lunch or quick dinner. \n\nCheap and spicy!!\n\nLove.   This was definitely a 'Meh' experience. The fast food of ramen- not terrible, but definitely not good.\nThe menu does offer a lot to pick from if you're looking to snack, but I wouldn't bother with the ramen at all.  Broth is decent (for Montreal). Noodles are OK (for Montreal). However, there is no edible ramen place within 2 km so this will do.  I took the spicy ramen mmmm feel so good in a freeze day. Crowdy place, good service.   One of the better ramen joints in Montreal, and certainly the best in Chinatown!  Fun ambiance, a good menu (much more than ramen if you feel like a change!), and lots of seating.   I'll admit it. I came here because Naruto likes ramen and I've rarely had it outside those really cheap bags of noodles you boil when you're in college. Or at work for lunch. I was a solo lunch diner, as I had dipped out of a conference for some better food than the conference center was offering. This place delivered. It was clean and the service was FAST. The ramen was delicious, and the recommendation of the server was spot on. Decor was modern and had several nods to anime. If I lived in the area I would probably be back here.

The studio is clean and comfy. Definitely one of the better places I've been to. I'm very pleased with my tattoo and will be coming back for more work.

It is rare to find a tattoo shop and good artist as quickly as I did. Collin at West Coast was awesome! Friendly, great tattoo artist and made my visit quick and easy.

Such an awesome atmosphere and friendly people. Definitely recommend this establishment for tattoos!! West coast f@ckin rocks!  My husband and I went in for a lock and key tattoo. We were incredibly thrilled with the work our artist, Colin, did.  He was great and drew our vision of them to create something just perfect for us. We will definitely attempt to have Colin do the next tattoo when we come back to Vegas.   I was originally a walk-in with a kinda unusual request to have a micro tattoo on my finger...

I've lived nearby for more years than this location has existed, and have visited this location maybe 20 times. Unfortunately, 99% of Avondale restaurants fall victim to seamy clientele. They manage to entirely ruin most businesses around here. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, you were doing well to find your salad was made with all fresh ingredients. Then they started tasting  slightly more spoiled. Now my husband and I find they can't even get themselves together to sell us a pastry or smoothie.  They are lucky that they even get one star because I don't think they deserve that. The girl taking my order had no idea what she was doing so I'm assuming she was new, which leads me to believe the person that should be training her obviously had better things to do. I picked up my order and got back to work. The apple that came with the food was disgusting. How can you say fresh food and be known for having healthy meals when you are serving rotten food??? You would think that they could at least look at the food they are sticking into the bags, must be too much work to do that...  Normally this place is awesome, occasionally packed but worth the wait.  Today not so great! Not just out of one thing today but 4! they didn't have chicken noodle soup,macaroni and cheese, onion soup or green tea. Then they said onion soup isn't a Sunday soup, even though it's on the menu online for Sunday. After I paid I realized they were out of tea, and the kid said oh yes we're  waiting for a shipment. Be out one thing ok fine but 4 things is ridiculous. Some one did horrible job when ordering this week!  I should have asked for a refund and went to Zuppas! Definitely disappointed in today's  trip to Panera! Came in on a Tuesday around 1030am they were out of most of there bagels.  Their toaster was down so they heated it on a press poor choice came out hot like it was microwaved.  Coffee had a brew time of 9:15 however it was really bitter tasting by the time I got to it.  I requested a refund,  and they lost me as a customer.  I won't be returning to many other places for bagels in a big city like Phoenix.  We love Panera, food always seems fresh and is very tasty. The staff has ALWAYS been so very nice and courteous each time as well, we will be back many times! The broth bowls are very good, only tip  would be to ask for salad dressings on the side bc they do tend to put a little too much dressing on for my tastes.  Every time I come to Panera, there's never any disappointment. Today, however, was exceptionally delicious. I ate literally everything on my plate. The Mediterranean sandwich and Greek salad is so on par with gourmet restaurants. 10/10. way too over priced! small mac n cheese is $5. HALF a salad is $6 a SMALL drink is $2.50 RIDICULOUS! i don't recall Paradise being this expensive. overall a lunch for 2 was $30. although the salad was good, i could've bought a bigger size somewhere else for the same price!",
        "output": "Recently renovated , but the food is hit or miss. The food is often not very fresh and sometimes even rotten. Even the coffee doesn't seem fresh. They are frequently out of menu items and the price seems expensive considering the inconsistent quality. Staff are not very friendly or helpful either."

I've never seen my husband so happy shopping!  We definitely walked away with some great stuff at great prices!\n\nI'm sure this will be a trip we'll make a few times a year to stock up!   I usually hate outlet malls but this one isn't too bad. I wanted to do some shopping but didn't want to venture all the way into the valley. I found a few great deals to my surprise! I stopped at the Carter's baby clothes store, Under Armor, Vitamin World and lastly Gap. I will definitely be back. I had an enjoyable experience.   Very family friendly. It isn't too busy which is great for families. Dog friendly a plus!\n\nThere are outlets that have lines that go out the door for Coach and Michael Kors - not here. Nice shopping experience.\n\nThe splashpad is a great addition for the kiddos.   Love shopping here and spending time with my family a little bit for everyone,great place !!!  Not bad.  The entire mall is very clean.  It is about 75% occupied which is good in this economy.\n\nThey have a very large play area for kids if that is your thing.  And a food court with lots of vending machines through out.\n\nOverall, I was able to get a lot of work clothes for a really good price.  It was worth the drive for me  Great shopping!  My wife and I have been to outlets in other places outside of the Arizona and these outlets are just as great.  Fair prices, lots of food choices if you get hungry, plenty of parking, clean restrooms, helpful staff, and great products.  If you like the outlets then give these a visit.  Great trip. Super nice employees.  Even had a nice meal at Charlie's in the food court. Next time will come back when more of the stores are open.  Was very glad to see an increasing selection of stores, very surprised to see the North Face outlet store here- have only seen these in Woodbury and in Berkeley. Nice little area for kids to play, clean and not too crowded.",

I live in San Diego and have never had any chips this good! \nHIGHLY RECOMMEND  Angel waiter is the best. Food is awesome. And margaritas are good. Happy hour is good deal We have been searching high and low for a good Mexican restaurant and we finally found Haciendas and it blows everywhere else out of the water!! Exceptional customer service and amazing homemade authentic Mexican food! I highly recommend the Tacos El Pastor along with the tableside guacamole and Posole soup! It is our new favorite restaurant! I highly recommend it!  We've tried this place out twice now. Great ambiance and location. Food is ok. The burrito is served naked. looks weird and uninviting to eat, but taste ok. They do serve large portions, but would be nice to have lunch size options and pricing. How much should you pay for Mexican food? Less than what they charge is for sure! They follow a long line of unsuccessful restaurants in that location and will might be jinxed! I would not recommend this place. Many other choices in the area! Save your money!  Good food the service was terrible ! Will not go back because of the service! \nWaited 20 min for salsa refill then they lost our order. Just about to walk out when they realized we were ignored. If I were you I would not go there if hungry! Even then I had to walk out to get my bill ! Pathetic !  Great food and great service!! Our waiter Rudy was so nice and attentive , definitely will go back. Don't pass on the table side guacamole , and ask for hot salsa , has a great flavor to go with a he\u00c3\u00a1t that will make you down your oversized margarita quickly.  Fajitas were good and big enough to share.  This has become our favorite restaurant. The staff is friendly and personable; they'll remember you every time you come in.

I've ordered lots of chinese delivery since being in AZ. and this is place was actually surprisingly better than most.  I'm always hesitant when ordering from a new Asian restaurant from so many bad experiences here.\n\nThe lady on the phone was typical of any other Asian restaurant and very friendly.\n\nOrdered orange beef, sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp vegetable,  all were really good surprisingly.  The orange beef is probably the best I've had from a delivery, could use a lil more spiciness. \n\nPrices were better than most places as well.  Would order again.  Good food great for take out to take to work. Always ready when I come to pick up. Really like their shrimp fried rice and soups.  The food was delicious, price was pretty good, but the lack of atmosphere and food being served on Styrofoam plates was a bit of a turn off.   Group of three, we all loved it. Had it delivered and it was hot, fresh and very tasty. No complaints, definitely recommend the Kung pao and orange chicken. If you like spicy, be very specific or they hold back. The flavor was still really good though. Would go back anytime.  Great Chinese for a fast easy fix. I've been going here for years! Orange chicken is my families favorite! The pork egg foo young has a ton of vegetables and is worth your dollar. The staff is friendly and the location is clean. Only down side was the bathroom door doesn't shut it seems to be jammed. My husband and I had dinner here last night and the food is fresh and amazing! I've not had Chinese food this good in a very long time. My husband isn't really into Chinese food and I can call him a skeptic but he wanted me to tell all you yelpers that this place has the best Chinese food he's ever had. (and mind you he's really picky) We will definitely come back to this place and the service is awesome! Ive been here 3 times. It's decent prices for the portions and food is great! Service is fast and friendly.",

We enjoyed coming here but still enjoy our favorite \"old places\" more.  Convenient location just off the highway. WARNING!! I was heard this place was good but I was so so disappointed and upset after trying it. I went with a group of 8 friends here, although my food was average, two of my friends got some type of chicken stir fry dish. The chicken in the dish was spoiled and had a rotting smell! And I know for a fact the smell was not from any sauce or spice, it was just plain spoiled chicken! The waitress was informed and removed it from the bill but I think I should of called the county health inspector. And we took my 2 friends to a urgent care for a per-caution for food poisoning and both later did vomit the food up. Obviously I will never return here and WARN others. In search for a different non chain place to eat for lunch today, I found this new gem! It is well located just south of the 1-10. The restaurant is clean and the servers were very friendly. \nI ordered the vegetable and tofu jasmine rice dish. The sauce was very well seasoned and the tofu had great flavor. There were a few too many onions but overall the flavor was great! The shrimp spring rolls are good but the peanut could use some more flavor. \nThe prices are very reasonable. Most dishes are ~$6.99. \nOverall great experience so my husband and I will be back to try out ore dishes on the menu. Really enjoy this pho spot. Only reason why I'm leaving 3 stars is due to the fact that I placed a to go order, and when I arrived 20 min later (which they said it'd be ready in 20) they said they never received the order. So I had to wait an additional 20 minutes for an order I called in 20 minutes ago! And to top off the filet mignonette dish I ordered tasted as if I were biting into ginger. Was not happy with my order this time when I know how good this spot can be.  I love how this place looks! I feel like I'm in a pho restaurant in California! \n\nI ordered the Mi Xao and Banh Xeo.. The food was was average.\n\nCustomer service wise, our sever forgot my friends order so he sat there while we all ate our food haha.   Consistently great! The food is always delicious and the staff is very pleasant. If you like pho, you must come here.  I eat at Kauai Pho in Lihue at least 2, 3 times a month or I try to make it as much as I can because:\n1) Awesome owners\n2) great samien, way better then Hamuras because Pho makes everything natural n healthy.\n3) As a steady customer I don't even have to tell them what my order is because they already know me n what I love eating.\n4) Their shrimp yellow noodle saimen is plain \"AWESOME!!!\"\nI give then a 20 star rating... Wow,wow,wow!!!! Originally from Los Angeles where there are tons of really good pho places to eat.I moved to the west side (buckeye) a year ago ,and have not been able to find a good pho place. I had gone to PT noddles in Goodyear,but\nUnfortunately it wasn't that good(sorry). Found this place and talk to the guy at the counter...he said they were only 3 months old...Wow,the food was super good..a lot of noodles and the meat was super good..very clean and friendly establishment...They got themselves a new returning customer for life!!!would definitely recommend to my friends!!A++",

There is a lot of good food to choose from, whether you're in the mood for a sushi dish, some stir fry chicken, or a vegetarian option.  Every mean is packed with veggies so you never leave feeling like you pigged out on something unhealthy.  The look and feel of the place is pretty unique as well."

I am a big fan of seafood, seafood tower and lobster chowder was a hit. For the main course, I got the porterhouse steak and a side of lobster mashed potatoes. And my dad ordered filet mignon. It was all very delicious, but 250$ later. I wish it a bit cheaper, so I could come here more often.\n\nThank for great meal! Phenomenal. This is NOT like other steak houses. The decor and ambiance is very comfortable and beautiful. Bidet toilets in the women's room. The service is excellent, crumber for the table, fresh cracked pepper, wine poured once your glass gets low, complete attention to detail. The \"bread\" that's brought is a full olive and cheese spread. The caesar salad is delicious. The scallops are cooked to perfection and the pairings on the plate were unbelievable. The Chilean sea bass was crisped and tasty, with a seamless and unbreakable sauce. The truffle mac and cheese was delightful and light. I did not think H60 was more expensive than any other great steak house. Amazing meal and date night out. One of the best places in town for a steak. Always an amazing meal and excellent service. My favourite steak in Toronto . I find the service and food always to be perfect ...more on the classic side .. But never a bad experience  I love harour sixty. it's such an old world charming place. I also love that for a steak house, it offers a wide array of selection in other dishes (I hate going to steak houses when I'm not in the mood at the insistence of my company and not having any options). \nAnd of course, everything is super delicious and the service is always impeccable.   It's pretty much as you expect for the money.\n\nNothing to complain in terms of food but in comparison to barbarians it is more expensive...\n\nAnd no pickled vegetables for appetizers :(  Excellent steaks! Rented the private dining room for a group reservation. Food was excellent but room was noisy and at the end the orders all got mixed up and wait staff was bringing either wrong items or serving them to the wrong guests. I believe the food is great but the service could be better.  Amazing experience here.  Top notch service, everything came through as expected for Harbour Sixty.  You get what you pay for.  We saw some Leafs hanging out at the bar and a couple who sat in front of each other for an hour and a half and did not say more than two words to each other. I guess money doesn't buy you happiness, but it can get you a solid meal.",

This was just the kind of thing I needed after the holidays, and as a special treat to myself. If I could give this place more stars I would, and I'll definitely be a returning customer.  Awesome place. Got a 90 min massage from Jose. He is amazing, definitely planning on going back for other services. The view of that lake is so pretty, check it out after your down. Barbara has hands from the heavens! Best massage ever! Great atmosphere at the spa too. Definitely will be back everyone is so friendly. Had a couples massage and foot scrub for our anniversary. It was amazing! They have wonderful deals and service. We will be back. This place was a great find. The big hotel chains charge way too much. I got a 3 hour treatment for what you'd pay in one of the big hotels for an hour. My massage, facial, and foot awakening was great. I especially liked Diane she was very friendly and I didn't feel like the last client of the night (even though I was). I'd go back in a heart beat. Sooo relaxing! Highly recommend.

The decorations were almost non existent on all of the cupcakes.  For the price and hoop la about this place you just expect more.  Yummy!!! I had the tickle me pink chocolate cupcake which I enjoyed very much! Service was great! I came over to the Monte Carlo specifically for a cupcake because I had to have at least one during our LV trip.  This is located in the shops located behind the casino.  The first you noticed, of course, was the huge display cupcake sitting on the counter.  The walls were adorned with cute pink wallpaper and a few sets of cute t-shirts were set up.   All of the cakes looked good, but I decided to try the chocolate peanut butter cupcake.  The crunchy peanut butter frosting tasted delicious and the cake was good, but was not the best I have ever eaten.  And $3.75 was really expensive for one cupcake.  Oh well, it was my one cupcake in Vegas. More like the Cupcrapery.....\n\n1. Pretty and sparkly on the outside, nasty in the inside.  \n\n2.  I didn't read YELP first.  Fail.\n\n3.  Basically the same as what everyone else said.  Dry cupcakes.  Frosting is gritty sugar.  Not even the fluffy or creamy kind.  Just gritty.\n\n4.  I had the oh my gosh ganache, kir royale, coco frauline, and strawberry shortcake.   Out of the four the ganache was the most tolerable.  So I gave it four chances at least.  4 bucks on each cupcake.  Fail again.  Went to vegas for a bday celebration and instead of getting a cake we decided to get a dozen cupcakes for the birthday boy!!!\n\nI don't specifically remember all the cupcakes but I do remember the Kir Royale cupcake because it was simply beautiful. Edible (?) glitter topped the delicate frosting and I want another one now!!! Sure it's pricey but it's vegas. Anyways, would come back for a sweet treat.   For the price, you would expect more.  \n\nThe deserts at the buffets were better!   I don't know what everyone else is talking about. This place had a pretty good cupcake. I had a Kir Royale, raspberry cupcake, champagne infused, and with silver glitter to top. Maybe if I were super picky, I would say it was a tiny bit dry, but I'm not going to be so critical. The raspberry taste and the frosting made the cupcake fantastic. Yum. \n\nI'm hopefully going to try the cinnamon roll one and the orange-pineapple one.   I'd give it a four if the goal was to have a Little Debbie, but even then this place falls short. Not a good choice. If you're looking for a sweet treat, there is a Pink Berry in front of The Cosmopolitan.",

I had a bad boba experience at a different shop and swore off boba since then, but a friend introduced me to Fuku and I have never looked back.\n\nMy order is accurate every single time, no matter what I order (I highly recommend getting the Thai Iced Tea with boba). The tea itself is delicious, and service is incredibly fast. Never heard a single complaint about them. I love it so much, I go weekly. That much.  10/10 one of the best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh. Drinks are made fresh and delicious. Cups are a little smaller than the everyday noodles (in squirrel hill) bubble tea cups but Fuku tea is cheaper. Loved the new green Thai tea drink! Recommend this drink with grass jelly ^_^ also the regular Thai tea is my fav at Fuku tea and a must have for people who love sweet drinks!  Fuku is on my top two best bubble tea places in Pittsburgh! I would say Fuku is great for fruity/tea drinks, whereas at Everyday Noodles I'd prefer to get milk teas there. My go-to is usually the traditional green tea, no sweetness, tapioca topping with honey and peach/mango flavors. Or I would get the golden lemonade. \n\nFuku is a really popular place to hang out with friends, do casual meet-ups, or even study. I think I usually run into someone I know every time I go there haha. Best bubble tea fix when coming back to school :)   This little shop just had their soft opening, and so far, I'm really liking what Fuku Tea has to offer to Oakland. The bubble tea here is delicious and more customizable than the other bubble tea stores on campus (and cheaper than Chick 'N Bubbly), and the store sells cute pastries, including macaroons. Fuku Tea also sells loose, hot teas, which I will definitely be trying in the winter. I'm considering coming here from now on for at least their bubble tea.   It was cool that you could choose ingredients and toppings. The people there also so nice and happy to start their first days\n\nI went back there today and they still seems very excited about their business. They are happy to interact and provide good service. \n\nThe tea there is also nice. I like both their green tea and black tea though so far I prefered green tea as it has a lighter taste in my opinion. I'm never tried the bubbled teas with milk but I recommened both the mango and the Almond flavor. Don't forget the tropica as they are what makes bubble tea fun right?  Nice little shop in the heart of Oakland; the boba was actually a little disappointing because it didn't mix as well as it should have, but the little dessert I bought (a chocolate mousse) made up for it enough for me to swing them up to a 4 star rating. Seems like a nice place to study.  I love how clean and straight forward this place is! They have a lot of the authentic loose tea options along with their signature milk teas and smoothies.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast. I also LOVE that they have a soy milk option. It changes EVERYTHING for me since I'm lactose-intolerant. I ordered the small Thai iced tea with soy milk and it tasted DELICIOUS. The tapioca pearls were soft and chewy. Prices were fair. \n\nI will come back here for future boba tea purchases!   Great bubble tea. I got a coconut black tea with bubbles and was very happy with it. Glad to see they rinse their tapioca until they are fully hydrated and then hold them in a warm crock prior to serving, so they are not under-cooked at all upon serving.\n\nAlso, they don't skimp out on bubbles, I got about half a cup in a small tea. I'll be back again.",

I found a quote to replace my windshield from their website and when I called the manager, Chris, said they would do it for less and have me out the door in less than an hour. I waited less than 20 minutes and my windshield was finished. These guys are awesome! Best deal in town with the best customer service! I moved to Las Vegas 3 years+ ago, and my convertible top was damaged from old age.  I asked the guys at Superior for a recommendation on a place to get the top repaired since they are family owned and operated.  When I went to their recommended place (West Charelston Auto Upholstery) the Todd Craik at WCAU did the repair free of charge.\n\nAbout 1 month ago I wanted to sell my old 2004 Honda Civic, which had a cracked windshield.  I asked Superior for their best cash price (i.e. Green $ no credit card) and the finished the installation in 35 minutes with an appointment all for $140!  They are competitive and fast! Amazing customer service from the Manager, Chris.  I got one of my cars tinted about 2 years ago and it's still great to this day (so great that I got my other car tinted as well!) \n\n\nGood prices and quick turn around\n\n\nI definitely recommend these guys!  Needing a windshield replacement, I called several different places before coming across Superior. I spoke to Chris who quoted me a price that was nearly half of every other company I called. Needless to say I was hesitant because it sounded too good to be true but I decided to use Superior anyway. Thank goodness I did! Chris was accommodating to my last minute schedule changes, open to any questions and concerns I had, and (most importantly) he stayed true to his price quote and didn't try to get more money out of me.  My windshield looks awesome and I am completely satisfied with the quality of work that Chris provided.  I will definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know!  Just had my car windows tinted today.  Bob was very helpful and my car was done in about an hour...he also gave me a good price.  Great job and very efficient.  I am recommending Superior to friends and family. Chris is beyond professional. Quality work, awesome business. Came to get my windows tinted and they got me right in. Took about 2 hours and the price was very fair. You get what you pay for! :) I wish I could rate them more than 5 stars. Chris was amazing, from speaking to him on the phone to meeting him in person. He was so enthusiastic and willing to help us out. We're from California and happened to get a chip on the windshield during the drive out to Vegas, but I would drive out here for the great prices and fantastic service. I highly recommend Superior Auto Glass.  I got my front windshield replaced after a rock cracked it ... he gave me a great price , and through phone call and in person was excellent customer service! He said it was an hr wait and i think they even did it faster than that ! I would highly recommend them to anybody i know .. one of the best services ive had in awhile in this town...",

When I called Chris on the phone he went above and beyond to help me. Fast service too!"

As is typical with Vegas, when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another.  Why not but actually we'd like to taste it.  I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good..  The make your own salad with up to ten items was great.  Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good.  We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along.  Will go back.   We had our wedding reception dinner here. We had a family style prix fixe with an emphasis on seafood. Truly fantastic. Oysters, crab legs, etc. The family style was great, as everyone could try the perfectly cooked steak, scallops, or salmon (the chicken was fine, but everything else was significantly better). \n\nService was also top notch. There were several people continually helping with each course and making adjustments (wait for the next course, bring the next one faster, etc.). At the end, there was a small mixup with the pricing but that was quickly resolved.   First of all, I am a seafood fan. And both times I went here I was a guest of someone else so I wasn't paying the bill.\n\nThat being said, the lobster corn dogs are amazing! Also the chilean sea bass. Get the salad that you can customize and you will not be disappointed.  First time dining here.  Heard much about Michael Mina.  Place was pretty empty at 6pm on a Friday night.  \n\nFood was a absolute 10, but the wait service was a 2.  I must say the buser was fantastic.  Our server was too chatty about nothing and was not helpful in making choices. Drinks went dry often this night, we would getr so partched.\n\nFod was fabulous. Appetizer octopus and smelt fries were tasty and inovative.  The angry lobster and grilled scallops were perfect.  Spicy lobster on a bed of fideo with baby leeks, artichokes and fennel.  The scallops were so tender just warmed through. Amazing!  If you are local and haven't noticed, many properties like MGM have spring/summer tasting menus that are perfect for a nice night out.  They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3-4 course menu.  One of our fav meals so far still, and we've been here 6 years.  For an overpriced Vegas restaurant, this one isn't bad.  Great seafood platter, good scallops, excellent scalloped potatoes, and they threw in some more potatoes since we ordered so much stuff.  Dinner # 2 of last week's vegas trip.  \n\n I wasn't so hot on the space, as I felt like I could have been eating in a chain restaurant.\n\nThere was also zero talent in the place.  For Vegas, even during a guy-dominated convention, that is simply inexcusable (and don't forget that the AVNers were showing up around then). My friends and I stayed at MGM last week. After hitting a straight flush in three card poker I thought I'd take the guys out to a solid dinner. For an appetizer we ordered the king crab legs, which were nice and fresh and provided just enough for 3-4 of us to sample a couple legs.  I ordered the salmon and had it cooked medium.  Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I believe the others ordered scallops, steak, and pasta.  Definitely worth checking out if you win some money at the casino, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere considering the steep price for the good, but not excellent food.",
        "output": "This place will leave you with very satisfied.  Definitely one of the best seafood joints in Vegas.  They have a very large menu to choose from and it includes things like oysters, lobster, crabs, pretty much anything you could want as far as seafood.  They even mix in steak and chicken to some of the meals.  I was very impressed."

        "input": "The food is fresh and amazing. We ordered the grilled chicken platter and tea and everything was extremely good. You can tell the food is authentic and the owner is very friendly. This is our third visit in two weeks and we will definitely be back.  Exceptional. Well priced, phenomenal service, fresh and high quality ingredients, and delicious food. I had beef kabob, rice, and vegetables, accompanied with the fresh, made daily in house bread. The meal was served with a great salad, which may be the nicest house salad I've ever seen. I found myself returning the next day and tried the chicken kabob, which was again perfectly cooked and seasoned. For the price you get a very good amount of food. They don't over do it at all, you will feel satisfied after your mean but not overly stuffed. I have no hesitation returning to this restaurant and recommending it to others.  MoMo's is an absolute gem of a restaurant!  The food is incredibly tasty--perfectly spiced and cooked.  All ingredients are fresh and high-quality.  If you are looking for truly outstanding, authentic, healthy food--this is your place.  Our server was incredibly attentive and welcoming.  Price cannot be beat--we fed our family of 4 here including fresh salads, delicious moroccan tea for all, generous meals, fresh-baked bread, and the amazing French cookie sampler, all for under $45.  We truly enjoyed this place and recommend highly to others!  The food was fantastic (lamb medallions) and the service was excellent. The food was cooked to perfection and tasted very fresh. The owner is very personable, friendly, and attentive. Make sure you tell them if you want the tea or not because it will be added to your bill. We never asked for it but it was presented so we thought it was included. Enjoy!  We haven't had good moroccan food in cleveland in quite some time. Place is a small sit down spot right down the block from cedar lee cinema. My wife and sis each had a kabob, one chicken and one beef they were both season well and pretty good, but not the best I ever had. But what I really enjoyed was the couscous which is a north african staple. The restaurant has couscous on fridays and tajines on saturday as specials. I got the lamb couscous (pictured) but beef and vegan couscous were also offered as options. Plus a pot of moroccan mint tea for $5, I will def be coming back to explore more menu options  Absolutely recommend this one and only Moroccan restaurant in Cleveland! Three of us shared tabouli, beef kabob, chicken kabob, Harira soup, French cookies and hot sweet mint tea. They cook with a wood fired oven that brings a delicious smokey flavor to the food. Even the veggies were cooked in the oven. The bread was divine! The decor was of course very Moroccan with fluffy sofas and several colorful poufs to sit on. Muhammed is a very friendly host. Definitely check this place out!   An authentic Moroccan experience! Start with the mint tea and order the special of the day. If it is beef tajine (like today's lunch), then you're in for a real treat! The owner, Mo will start you off with a crisp salad and warm bread. A few minutes after you're done, he will bring out a traditional tajine earthen pot. Lift the lift and enjoy!  (4.5) Dope place with awesome tea and delicious cookies. The menu may be simple but the food is all great. Even the bread is delicious! Everything tastes extremely fresh. It's like the chef just bought everything the same day. \n\nThe service is great and courteous. If you get the mint tea the server will give it to you the Moroccan way!",
        "output": "If you are in the market for some great fresh food this is a wonderful restaurant to check out. The food is authentically Moroccan and they always have great specials that change every day. All of their kabobs feature excellent cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, and are cooked and seasoned to perfection. I also recommend trying their mint tea, it is amazing."

        "input": "Don't be fooled by the name, it is possible to eat healthy foods at this establishment. The manager was very nice and offered me a lot of drink choices that were both nondairy and fruit-based. I was able to put together a low carbohydrate soy coconut smoothie that was both delicious and healthy. I'm very happy to come here again knowing that this place caters to everyone.   This place is pretty small, but they have a lot of donut choices. They also sell boba (Asian drink). The place is cozy. My kids loves it. I'm not a big donut fan but they got good flavors. Definitely coming here next time.\nGood customer service.  There is a reason this place has such good reviews (in my opinion it deserves 5 stars). Every time I have gone, the owner always gives me a couple of donut holes, free of charge. I don't eat donuts often, but when I'm in the mood for one I'm fortunate enough to live just down the street from this place. Everyone in the Mesa area should come here at least once. Their coconut cream filled donuts are to die for. Their smoothies are amazing too. If I could write a million 5-star reviews for them, I absolutely would. Would give this place more stars, but I haven't tried my raspberry fritter yet. This review is for their drinks. Unfortunately, they use powdered flavoring a for their drinks. I was excited when she had said that they use \"real fruit\" in their fruit yogurt drinks. To my disappointment, even asking if she could add some extra blueberries, she poured in about 5-6 blueberries over about 2 ounces of a liquefied yogurt, added powdered flavoring a and ice and water, and there appeared my wonderful blueberry yogurt shake. No thanks.... Maybe I would come again for donuts. Best donuts I have found in Mesa or AZ in the 28 years I've lived here! Excellent selection, Friendly people and YUMMY!  This has become our new weekend tradition to grab some donuts and a boba tea. We found this place a couple months ago and have loved it everytime. The staff there is extremely friendly and welcoming and of course all the donuts are delicious! If you haven't stopped in before, definitely check it out and you won't be disappointed!!   THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!! Look, I'm not saying this place is necessarily a place I'd \"hang out\" at but everything they serve is simply awesome! You'll never want doughnuts from anywhere else again. Bubble Tea is here to if that's your deal!  Apparently we went here on an off day. We decided to stop in and try this new neighborhood donut shop. We ordered a berry smoothie, French Vanilla Iced Coffee and two old fashioned donuts. The smoothie was tasteless, the iced coffee was too sweet and the donuts were crunchy and tasted like grease dipped in sugar glaze. The boy (11 or 12 years old) that waited on us was very efficient and nice. Won't be back. We threw everything out, wasn't edible.",
        "output": "This place may be a doughnut shop but they serve much more than that. You can order a smoothie or tea, and with a bit of thinking you can even make it healthy. The doughnuts are of course awesome as they should be for a restaurant dedicated to them. Some of the smoothies are made with powdered flavorings if you dislike that kind of thing but they are great. They seem to have off days every once and awhile because the last time I was there the doughnuts tasted pretty bad but that was just one visit and everyone gets a second chance."

I have been going to Birdsong since they first opened. I have always enjoyed their Free Will. They have made a couple new brews as of late that I sampled and all are really good. I love that they are right across the way from Noda Brewery and tend to always go to both of them during my visits. I love the games and the free peanuts. For the quality of the beer, I feel the prices are really good. Hoping to see some additional brews in the future.   Birdsong is a gem. A true gem! I was over at NoDa and wandered back and around to Birdsong. The staff were vvery friendly and I found the bar a bit like home. They have a great outdoor area and, most importantly, their beer is quality.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of flavored beers. \nIPA POR VIDA!\nbut! their Jalapeno Pale Ale!? Hello deliciousness. Seriously. Give it a try.   Great beer to try! Fun flavors like Jalapeno Pale Ale. the staff inside is nice and friendly. I was able to get a t-shirt with no hassle at all. The outdoor seating area is wonderful. Birdsong is next door to NoDa, so you should definitely check it out!   Great atmosphere! Was a band on the Saturday night we were there that was excellent! The beers were wonderful as well, would be back!   This is a hiden gem....reminds me of Asheville ,nc nice happy laid bk plp and great beer. The JALEPENO PALE ALE was Amazen.....it drove my sinses in overload. The smell and taste wrk great for it, you have got to try!   Had the extra pale ale and loved it.\n\n In fact I loved everything about this place. The vibe was ideal for a long night of serious causal drinking. From the peanuts on the table to the friendly bartenders, this place just felt homey as soon as you sat on a stool. But unlike other dive this bar has delicious beer and an a chill atmosphere that really makes the beer go down quick and easy. \n\nI am looking forward to visiting again!  We thought that we would give this place a shot considering the positive reviews.  However our visit was all but positive.  First of all I don't believe that the air conditioning was working.  I know that in the past some places do this to encourage the beer consumption.  I don't necessarily have a problem with this but if thats the case at least make sure that the beer is cold.  I spoke to someone up at bar and she basically said that because the beer is brewed there its not served cold but just slightly colder than room temperature.  If I wanted a warm pint of bitter I'll go to the U.K.  Needless to say we won't be back.",
        "output": "If you're looking for a comfortable and inviting bar this is a great place to go. They have a lot of unique beers on tap that you will not find anywhere else. The staff here is extremely friendly, and after just a couple of minutes it feels like you are chatting with an old friend. The next time you want to head out for some drinks give them a shot!"

Me and my friend decided to go in and look around. \n\nAtmosphere was amazing! The staff was so nice, was talking to us. They knew the product and could tell us what bud was good or how it will react. Most clubs in California wouldn't be able to tell us all their products. \n\nI really liked this club and we will be coming back!  Essence is the best dispensary in Las Vegas. Really nice atmosphere & great product for a great price. Staff is the friendliest ! Alex @ this location is very helpful ! Yet again the bud is dry when can we get some sticky icky damn man lol but it was fire  A few days ago I received my approval letter  and based on reviews I knew exactly knew where to go. Che and Brian exceeded my expectations! Che was very friendly and welcoming. And Brian was very patient with me. I had no idea what I was going to get and he really helped me pick some flowers that definitely helped me get medicated the way I wanted to. And I was shocked about the prices! And they always have specials! And the staff treated me like a friend, not just a customer. I'll definitely be back again!",

Wow! Amazing food and impeccable service. Our waiter Danny was awesome, so accommodating and nice.. and Jackson was great too- infectious smile.   I have been to plenty and I mean plenty of Chinese and Hong Kong cuisine restaurants. Blossom has stood out, they do their own mix on traditional dishes. I recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Walnut Prawns, & the Fried Flounder. The walnut prawns are by far the best I've ever had, they are not completely soaked in the mayonnaise. There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination. The flounder is fried to a crisp and juicy. Overall, you're paying for what you get and this is a must stop in Vegas.   Amazing service!! Amazing food!!! Omg.... this place is so impressive!! The atmosphere is beautiful and Victor was so sweet and personable!! And Sam was the best server and so accommodating!! He made our dinner experience perfect. Let us taste wine, jokes around with us, recommended dishes and we were so impressed!!! Thank you Blossom!! We had a girls trip and we had reservations at STK, but last minute we canceled and came to blossom.... what a great choice!!!  5 stars for decor and ambience c/o Aria\n100 stars for customer service\n\nThe menu however didn't quite cut it for me. I'm vegetarian and there wasn't a whole lot on there that peaked my little taste buds. There's the usual spring rolls, fried rice, and soup you can go with but for such a high end restaurant I was expecting a little more. \n\nThe one thing you absolutely HAVE to try though is their Jasmine tea. It's the most delicious tea i've ever tasted and honestly that almost made up for the menu being not so awesome. auto loses a star because asian food should not be this expensive... food was great and the service was good but i just feel like i can get better asian food for a better price elsewhere... next We ordered Peking duck, spicy lobster fried rice and Chinese broccoli. I think only in Vegas you can spend 150.00 on three dishes for Chinese food. Okay enough about the price, overall I enjoyed my experience here at blossom. The staff were really attentive and I like all the high end decor. Definitely not your typical Chinese take out. Would I be coming back the next time I stay at Aria??, the answer would definitely be yes!!!  Foods were good, but the wait is too long in between for every meal to come out, the restaurant wasnt busy at all, needa work on time management guys!!!!!",
        "output": "Ok, so first of all, the food at Blossom is amazing.  Its some of the most quality Chinese food you'll ever eat.  The fried flounder is crispy and full of flavor!  The atmosphere is pretty good too.  The only bad thing is the fact that it will cost you an arm and a leg to eat  here.  But that's just the price you pay for quality food."

I went to this place maybe five times and my last visit the portions were way smaller. The food here is good but apparently they cut their portions. I ordered three wraps and all three of us were left hungry.\n\nThanks for responding, I went to your restaurant on Monday April 20th. I ordered 2 Balboas and a Santa Fe chicken wrap. I placed the order over the phone and the cashier seemed new or just confused. The main issue I had was the wraps, now in a smaller container weren't nearly as big. All three of us felt the same and were left somewhat disappointed.  I have recently been guided by my loving wife to a healthier eating lifestyle. It's been difficult because most of the time it tastes like dirt. Today I have been converted. I had this amazing meal that has me so converted that I decided to try out a weeks worth of meal preps. Being on the run my normal lunches consist of fast food and snacks. I think this may be a great solution to my issue of eating something actually good for me rather than something to just fill my gut. \n\nIf you want something awesome, try out the ahi and avocado salad. It was AMAZING!   I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Friendly staff, good food and lots of choices. I'll definitely be back.   In spite of the avg of three stars, this place is worthwhile. Food is tasty, carb-conscious, and made right in front of you. Service is good. D\u00c3\u00a9cor best described as \"bro\", which is a cool novelty. Across from Sportman's, which is also cool.\n\nOne star off for portion size.   Great atmosphere, food is tasty and staff is friendly. The restaurant was recently remodeled and the new owners are awesome! It's nice to go out to eat and not feel guilty about your calorie intake. I had the godfather and it was delicious. Give this place a try!   Been wanting to try this place for a while and finally went. Fist impression was i noticed the cooking line/area was cluttered a didnt look clean. The cooks were wearing gloves but unfortunately wiping sweat from their foreheads and continuing to cook and handle food.\n\nI ordered the mmg signature wrap which didnt taste bad but had a horrible smell to it, not sure if it was cheese or sauce or smells mixing with the side broccolli. The worst part about the experience is i have spent the last hour with repeated visits to the toilet after eating (sorry to be graphic).   The peach pear smoothie was pretty tasty. I unfortunately will not be back.  I appreciate seeing new healthy options in my city. \nIt's just sad to see that they aren't all great as they seem to be. A healthier approach should be tasty! \nI ordered the Mexicana which tasted like canned salsa on top; Sweet Potato fries which tasted like they were microwaved after being frozen ($3.99); and a side of guac $1.99 for 2 oz\n\nIt got me by from hunger but I would not be coming back.",

I really enjoyed the food though  The wine bar has a nice selection of wines, albeit a little on the expensive side. The service was decent although flagging down someone for another glass at times can be a bother. This seemed to be an issue for tables that were further from the bar. It was also nice to have the store right next door now as opposed to being across the street.   WInes by the glass change all the time.  A place where knowing about wine is helpful, but the choices are so well selected you won't make a mistake if you don't know anything.  The small plates are Really good.  Patio is great for people watching.  The wine flights are perfect for trying out new things! Love going here with girlfriends after a good movie right down the street(walking distance) at Phillips place theater.   I really love that this place is here & you can find speciality items that normal grocers don't carry. I was able to find some products I've had my eye on for a long time(the coconut cult probiotic yogurt)& ghee butter by fourth & heart. \n\nI love that this place is close by but omg it's expensive. I was so excited to find the goods but was also shock on how expensive they were. But overall I do plan to go back & try their deli. The fresh food looked & smelled soooo good!! It's a must I go back   I thought I'd write a short update to D&D Wine Room....\n\nThursday night Hubster and I went here for a glass-o-vino and to celebrate three things.  Me, My birthday, and the weekend.  LOL! I love everyone here.  So friendly, so nice, and....is that someone playing an acoustic guitar??  Such a wonderful touch!!  Sitting on the patio underneath the trees lined with white Christmas lights and listening to the amazing singer sing \"Marry Me\" almost brought me to tears.  It's the simple things in life....\n\nI heart you D&D wine room....thank you for a great Thursday night!   Who would have thought that December would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at Dean and DeLuca?  That is what I did today and it was divine.   I love coming here to build my own salad.  I had the pear vinaigrette dressing and I could have sucked that up through a straw.  Even though it is a little pricey, the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best.  It's also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items.  The atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping.  Definitely a winner in Charlotte.   I always stop in for a delicious sandwich before a movie. But, like an abusive relationship, I keep coming back for the hot sandwiches no matter how many times I get burned by the customer service.   The Dean & Deluca wine room never fails to deliver some of the very best food in Charlotte. No pretense, just really great quality food with a creative flair, and good spirited and attentive service. And they recently added valet parking making a visit to Phillips Place on a Fri or Saturday night seamless.",
        "output": "Dean & Deluca wine room is one of my favorite places to go before or right after a movie. The selection is amazing. The prices can be a bit high on some items but they make up for it with atmosphere and ambiance. The outdoor patio is perfect to sit back and relax with a glass of wine and people watch. There selection rotates often but you can always find something good. The added music just sets this place that much closer to perfection."

The drinks are over priced and the service is just okay. My card was misplaced for 5 minutes. The bartender told me she handed it back to me. I would know if my card was given back to me especially if it was on top of the receipt. I was made to feel really uncomfortable because I was told that I had misplaced my own card. The card was finally located in the bartenders cup which holds all of the receipts and cards. So it wasn't my fault.  Not sure if I will be back.  Friendly and attentive service, yummy tacos and stiff margaritas. Will definitely come back next time we're in town.   Awesome service, great atmosphere and really good tacos. Came in on taco Tuesday and could not have been more pleased.   It was my first time eating here, after driving by it so many times. The food was great and AMAZING service from Charity!!! Well definitely be back....she was awesome!!!  If I could give zero stars, I would. Service is awful awful awful AWFUL. 45 min for chicken nuggets and fries. Don't know their beers and whether they have it available or not... al pastor tastes like beef and nothing like the menu states. Get some more intelligent people to run your restaurant if you want to survive.  If you want a beer, great! If you want food, try some other place. The tacos, the burrito, the fries, no thank you.  I am so disappointed with this place. I saw the reviews but still decided to give them a try. The food was fine and the pricing was bad either. The service was TERRIBLE though. I will never give them another dime. The staff was rude and we didn't even get our drinks or even water until after the food was served. I really don't even know how this place in in business. They really need to upgrade their staff and get some new training.  dont do it. i love tacos and if you do to then go somewhere else. horchata was warm?? carne was bland, salsa was mild as ketchup, pastor was bland, the mf bill was sooooo high",

Tons of protein and veggie choices and sauces too.  On to the grill and a few minutes later we were chowing!   This is some of the most interesting and delicious food I've had in a LONG time. You get seated, then go up and load up your bowl. Many different meat choices, lots of veggies, and some very tasty sauces. Your food is cooked on a big grill, and normally comes out very quickly. The staff is always very nice to me. Will be coming back soon!   Great selection of fresh meats and vegi's - sauces are to die for; reasonably priced and kids love it.    Watch out for coupons, they have them often.  Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken. This place should be great.  It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run.  The service is sporadic and the erratic.   The proteins in the food bar were frozen.  The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away.   We got our appetizer after our entree. This was a fun place to eat,  you can build your own bowl (like a typical mongolian restaurant) and they have an unlimited option for $4 more which is great for trying different creations.  One thing i really liked was the \"starch\"  options. They offer noodles and rice,  but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element. Very reasonably priced. So far the best experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my entire life. I'm from India and moved to San Francisco in 2009 and I'm visiting family in charlotte. I believe our server name was BILL and he was very nice and polite and friendly. I haven't experienced that in many places. I felt so comfortable and welcoming. And of course the food was awesome I was kind of frustrated with the process but man the food came out great. Thanks for this great experience. You guys need to bring this to San Francisco!! And not to mention the free refills on the drinks and you can choose different drinks as well. Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9.99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook. Good thing I had a coupon so I was able to shave a little off the total. I think one visit is good enough for me.",
        "output": "They have an interesting and wide selection of food to choose from, which is really neat. However, the quality of the food is only okay, and I'm not sure I can recommend going here. Some of the food chews weird and is a bit pricey for what you get"

        "input": "I have been coming here for years.  They have good-priced combos with the salmon combo and bulgogi combos being my favourites.  Got takeout once and they included the extras (minus ice cream) that you normally get when dining in.\nThe service has also always been friendly.   Excellent and fresh ingredients, make this a must go to for tasty sushi.  Staff is friendly, but restaurant is a little small.  Salomon teriyaki is perfect with a reasonable price. Especially at Monday. Rolls are amazing too. Waitress and chef look kind and polite.  The salmon is of excellent quality.  Good service, Reasonable price..  Will keep coming back and definitely recommend it to my family and friends,  This is a nice little cozy restaurant for an off work weekday lunch, lazy weekend lunch, or regular evening takeout. It is open 7 days a week, for lunch and dinner, but the above mentioned times are when I usually come to eat. The place sits about 25 people, so if you have a big group, you might not want to consider this place.\n\nThe lunch specials are pretty good and the fish are pretty fresh too. For the price you are paying, you are getting a very good value in quality and portion. My favorite sushi joint hands down. At work, we'd go for the salmon sushi special ($7.95) every Tuesday for lunch. The sushi is always fresh and prepared at the perfect temperature. I thought I never had real salmon until this place. The chef is also super nice and sometimes gives us free hand rolls or extra sashimi slices.\nAfter years of thinking it's only worth it if it's AYCE, this place changed my mind about sushi. Came for dinner tonight. My first time here. This place is alright. Nothing amazing in my opinion but it was not bad either. Prices are reasonable for a Japanese Restaurant of average quality. I wouldn't travel far for this restaurant. Come if you are in the area and want some relatively cheap sushi.  We have been coming to this restaurant for years and it has always been a great experience. The owner & waitresses are friendly & attentive, and their fish is always fresh. Decent prices and good service!",
        "output": "The food here is terrific. I order something different each visit, and they always satisfy with fresh ingredients and quality Japanese cuisine. Service is friendly and amenable every time I come in, and the owners themselves are quite welcoming, too. Restaurant itself is on the smaller side, so very large dinner groups might have trouble finding room. If you come here, expect excellent food for a reasonable price!"

This place is awesome!  I am in love with the Twitch coffee bean they offer.  The coffee is smooth, no bitterness and styled to perfection.  The service is great, they pour your latte/cappuccino personally for you.  There's a Starbucks on every corner, it's nothing special, but there's only ONE Press!  I would drive across town for my Press....and I have!!  Hey when ya got a hankering for a twitch, ya gotta go!!!   I liked the vibe of this place. It reminded me of a few coffee houses I visited in Seattle. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Be careful with the \"toddy\" though - it's fantastic but will get you wired really quick!   I am used to some good coffee roasters in L.A. so I am a little picky.  It was o.k., but nothing above average.  Latte art - check, nice Scottsdale Quarter mall - check, great taste -  meh....could be better,  friendly employees - check.  Not sure where roasting is done because I could not see it or smell it on the premises.  I did not feel an indie/hipster vibe as Jessica M. stated.  It seemed like run of the mill Starbucks to me.   Yummy coffee with a personal touch. Not like the conveyor belt at Starbucks or Peets. \nFriendly staff and very good, rich coffee.   Always super friendly! Locally owned. Bomb cold brew. Offers periodic classes on coffee knowledge. Keep on keepin on, press.   Decent coffee, helpful staff.  I work at the Scottsdale Quarter so I visit Press regularly.  I don't particularly enjoy their brewed coffee as it has a funny after taste but I do enjoy their expresso. Their Apple Pay was broken and I didn't have my wallet so the cashier allowed me to pay later, great customer service.   Press just reopened after a quick remodel - they advertised a new capability - nitrogen infused cold brew, so had to give it a try - wasn't a huge fan of the cold brew the last time, and, while better with the nitrogen infusion (makes it look and feel like a freshly pulled Guinness), it's still not my cup of tea...er...coffee.\n\nI'll go back to my old standby of cappuccinos or shots of espresso.\n\nAlso, love their Twitch beans for the Jura machine at home.",
        "output": "The staff here and friendly and helpful. They offer classes if you're interested in improving your coffee knowledge! They pour your lattes for you personally and can do latte art as well. A step up from and more personalized than other local corporate owned options."

I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum!   Hadn't been there in several years and after this visit I remember why, I don't like onions or shallots in my macaroni and cheese. The food is good but not worth the price just a very disappointing experience and I probably won't go back   My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary (literally every year we have been married). The service is exceptional and the food quality is top-notch. Furthermore, the happy hour is one of the best in the Valley. In addition to excellent drinks, they offer free prime filet steak sandwiches. I highly recommend this place for celebrations or a nice dinner out.   I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there.   Very good steak house.  Steaks are high quality and the service was very professional.  Attentive, but not hovering.  Classic menus and atmosphere for this kind of restaurant. No surprises. A solid option, but not a clear favorite compared to other restaurants in this category.  Had a wonderful experience here last night for restaurant week. Had the filet... Which was amazing and cooked perfectly with their yummy mashed potatoes and veggies. The bottle of red wine they offered for an additional $20 paired perfectly with the dinner. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!  The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood, which is good, which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious.  Its good to know that you can get top rate seafood in Phoenix.  Bacon wrapped scallops were very good, and I sacrificied a full steak (opting for the filet medallion) to try the scallops.  I asked for medium rare steak, but maybe shouldve asked for rare...my cousin had the ribeye and could not have been any happier than he was :)  \n\nyum for fancy steak houses.  \nIts an ultra romantic place to, fyi.\nthe wait staff is very attentive.   Donovans, how can you go wrong.  Had some guests in town and some fantastic steaks paired with some great cabernets.  Really enjoyed my filet and lobster.",
        "output": "The steak is the must have dish at this restaurant. One small problem with the steak is that you want to order it cooked less than you would at a normal restaurant. They have the habit of going a bit over on the steak. The drinks are excellent and the stuffed mushrooms as appetizers were amazing. This is a classy place that is also romantic. The staff pays good attention to you here."

Great addition to King East! \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the bathrooms were pretty dirty and my chair at the table still had crumbs on it.  I dislike soggy pizzas. This place doesn't serve soggy pizzas! Great food, great service, and comfortable and relaxing environment.  Loved the atmosphere and the feel of the whole place. I had the Aloha Smoke it was great.

The pizza was cooked to perfection with fresh toppings. Staff were friendly and efficient. Will most definitely be back. Amazing Salads!!! Went here with my co-workers who wanted a quick pizza lunch and we tried a couple of the new meal sized salads. They were so delicious and a nice option if you don't feel like a pizza like the rest of your group.  This place was one of those make your own pizza places. The whole process from ordering, choosing toppings, and receiving the baked end result was quite a breeze. I loved that they had eggs as one of their topping options.\n\nTaste is quite good for my palette, though I kinda wished that the crust was a bit crispier and had more charcoal texture. Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite of good pizza!",

We are regulars in Gilbert at a number of places and I have been to just about every worthwhile wine bar, tapas place, or cocktail lounge in AZ and a lot of the west coast and this place doesn't compare.  The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music.  The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff.  I ordered a burger with no cheese and of course it has cheese.  No dairy, a simple request.  Made another and it was practically raw.  I should give it 1 star but whatever.  Won't be back.  I am smitten with the Barrelhouse. Justin, Eric, and Sandy made my experience wonderful. They had a flirty menu of cocktails that played sultry, sensory  games in my mouth....providing me with a balance of flavors and the tastes of true mixology. I was impressed with the staffs knowledge and passion for all things mixable and drinkable. Haha. I recommended these guys for their unforgettable spirits,  fine conversations, and an immeasurable  quality of service. Simply sweet.   I'm so happy to have tried Barrelhouse! Stopped there for lunch today and had the Harvest Salad (beets, blue cheese, candied pecans, jicama, and field greens) and split the chocolate pot de creme with a friend. Heaven!! The restaurant is beautifully decorated inside and it was easy to forget we were in a strip mall in Chandler. This is my new favorite place.   Since our initial two visits, we've dined several more times. Often, Diana is our server and she is fantastic! She addresses us by name and very pleasant to talk with. We will continue to visit Barrelhouse.   We had several craft brews and the waitress had a ton of knowledge. Great draft beer selection. Ordered the burger.......amazing. It came with the garlic fries. Location is terrible, never would have found this place without yelp. Thank you yelp, we will be back!!!   I tried this place for  the first time last Tuesday night with my girlfriend. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Justin the bartender made us the most incredible drinks,..he is a master at his craft. The food we had was absolutely amazing!! I will be back.   Superb dining experience. From the thick cut potato chip snack, the warm cheddar bisquits through the salad of field greens with candied pecans and blue cheese, to the duck confit and lobster baked chili rellenos, everything was a feast for the tastebuds. We hardly had room for the white chocolate and raspberry bread pudding but couldn't  leave without trying it- we were not disappointed. Barrelhouse ranks among the top restaurants in greater Phoenix.   It kills me that this place is closing! That location is cursed! Thank you to the owners and staff for the delicious meals I've eaten and tasty drinks I've drank, I will miss Barrelhouse greatly!!",

Try the meatballs for an appetizer, then the lobster burrata and the wild boar bolognese as entrees...all amazing!  Gnocchi and lasagna was awesome!  Drinks are pricey and food prices are what to expect for a $$$.  $8 for domestics is a little crazy  Overpriced, very mediocre Italian. Given the choices in town I would avoid this place. Not to mention the Mirage had a sick nauseating smell of cigarette smoke they tried to cover with a sweet smelling deodorant. It permeates the whole casino. I would vastly prefer the smell of cigarette smoke alone.  Food was delicious! I had the butternut squash gnocchi. My bf even received 20% off of our bill bc he was a local. How awesome. We will definitely be coming back. Absolutely the worst \"Italian\" food I never taste. We dine Monday night, with reservation, 2 adult and our child. \nService!!! do not exist, I saw my server twice during dinner, at the beginning when the hostess introduced him and at the end to drop the check. My wine and food order was took by the manager/sommelier \"the only positive note of our experience\" The food is a joke from quality, taste, flavors, presentation. We started with the arugula salad. Which i found to be very good. The price is high but what do you expect in Vegas? The food was good but it is a lot to be spending on food that wasn't anything spectacular.. Lasagna was okay the salmon was much better!!  My husband and I tried to recreate our first date at this place. It used to be called \"Onda\" when we met.\nEven though the restaurant is now called Portofino, the service was absolutely amazing and the general manager Chris Zadie was very accommodating to our needs. He made our night extra special with the superb and impeccable service. \nIt's nice to feel like you are valuable as a customer.

I had to wait 15 minutes before someone even saw me inside the store and they weren't even busy! I usually get the same coffee and today it was just not very good... Very disappointed.... Customer service is always more important than the food quality, that's why I give it 1 star. I was in the drive thru, had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffee (there was more ice than coffee) and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice. I guess she thought I was stupid and that I wouldn't notice. So I sent her back to take out more. Do the job right the first time and you won't have to do it twice. I guess she didn't think I would notice that she didn't even take out any ice. My frozen hot chocolate was delicious but they only cream cheesed one half of my bagel. I guess it's my fault for coming to a donut place and ordering a bagel lol Totally disappointed in this Dunkin Donuts as I purchased my coffee from Dunkin Donuts every single morning on my way to work. But today after a late lunch I decided to go grab a coffee I ordered one large Almond Joy iced coffee weighted at the window for 10 minutes just for someone to come to the window to collect my money after the lady came and collected the money we sat there for another 5 minutes just to get one coffee there was no one there there was no cars in front of us we were the only car why was the wait so long. I and my girlfriend wanted morning coffee, and we found it in this place. \"Espresso\" was good and strong like i like. Mygirlfriend order \"latte\" - it was good but not enought. Donuts was freash and tasty. Only minus - waiting. 10 minutes - it's too long for coffee and donuts.  Very slow service but at least it was service with a smile. The poor girl at the counter was taking orders, getting the donuts and she is was responsible for making the drinks. Poor girl...\n\nMy Carmel Machiado was BOMB!!!   My review is for the late evening . If you come in with an hour before closing, the donuts are old and stale. They must stop making fresh donuts early in the day and just sell what is left over. The donuts are heavier and denser that K Creme with less flavor.",

We did takeout but will come back and have a sit down meal. Highly recommend!! Very authentic Italian food.  Great ambience  and excellent service can't wait to come back again!! Never got to try the food which sounded amazing. Waited 5 minutes at the door and was never acknowledged by the three servers who walked by and got themselves drinks instead or the person on the phone who saw us and didn't acknowledge us either. There was also a customer wandering around trying to pay her bill with no one coming to help. \nPerhaps if they fix the wait staff we will try again. If this was a problem in an almost empty restaurant I can't imagine what it's like when it's crowded.  Had a lovely time here last night with my girlfriend. The inside interior is very cool and modern- a good retreat from the heat of Vegas. We ordered the mussels, Quattro Stagianno pizza, and the Alla Vodka Pasta with meatballs. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, but favorite was the alla vodka pasta!! It was so yummy we even forgot to take a picture of it. Recommend getting this for sure. We also got the house made cheesecake- really yummy and different. It's like if you mix a cannoli with a cheesecake. \nOverall- authentic, great date spot, comfort food, and top notch service.  Food was absolutely delicious and authentic! Bread is fresh and homemade! Wood fired pizza was fantastic! Happy hour specialties are reasonably priced. The caramel martini was out of this world. Beautifully decorated in a very modern style! The atmosphere is sophisticated and elegant! I'm really glad there is a local restaurant near us! The decor of the space  is very beautiful and clean.  There is a full bar and a very nice wine list. Affordable and realistic pricing. They have a well rounded food menu of traditional Italian dishes. We'll definitely be back! I only gave three stars because the server was rough around he edges. I'll assume that it is because it is a new restaurant and they are just getting on their feet. Excited to go back and try again!  Came here a few weeks ago right after it opened. Everything was pretty good and the pizza was solid. There are some kinks but it's new, I will give it another try and hopefully everything is worked out.  Excellent Italian food Happy Hour 3 to 6 everyday. Great garlic knots. Love the staff.

Ordering take out next time! Met my bf of 3 years here.  Was always my favorite country bar hands down.  Had a few friends in town and we wanted to take them here... We literally walked in then out.  It smelled so bad.  Barf & piss was the only way we all could describe it with really sticky floors.   The smell was so bad wasn't even worth it to hang outside.  We wanted to be inside dancing.  So we all left immediately and we were bummed we could not enjoy ourselves where we once met.  Really sad for us and hope it turns around because after this and talking around I've heard just hasn't been the same for a bit now.  I wish I could give no stars! I don't ever write reviews but I went there this past weekend and first of all they ran out of bud light, no big deal but the whiskey lemonade was terrible and customer service was even worse. The manager Ryan was not nice at all. He completely ignored my friends and I when we were just trying to get a better tasting whiskey lemonade. When I asked who the manager was he slapped my hand and told me he was and too back off. Then proceeded to ask the guys behind us in line what they wanted. I immediately left, night ruined.   I have given this place a try on more than one occasion. I have tried day drinking there and going at night on the weekend. This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar. If you're looking for a country bar, this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for another stereotypical college town party bar, this is your place.  Do they play country music most of the time? Yes. Do they have a mechanical bull? Yes. Do they have two-step dancing? Yes. But are they a country bar? Not exactly...\n\nMoonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist. They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well. Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time. They are also open on the weekend till 3 am.\n\nCheck it out! Wasn't impressed.  Walked in on a Sunday around 5. There were 4 people in the bar. Bar was dirty. Was going to order food but decided against it due to the mess. Had the apple pie moonshine. Flavor was good. Served in a shot glass. I understand it's a college bar but my friends and I wanted to have a drink not act like retarded frat boys. Maybe serve drinks in jars? This place is probably okay if you're looking to get drunk on a weekend. Not a place to go if you want to sit and catch up with some friends and do a little Sunday funday social drinking  In my option, this is a very good spot for country music. One thing i notice about the bar staff the prices are different ever time. I would clean that up because Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row will take them out of business.  The mechanical bull is fun way to bring in business   Went to this bar last night and had an overall great time. The guy out front who cards people was very friendly. There was good music playing, the male bartender made me a random drink & it was delicious! I think the drinks are over priced, though. The bar got really crowded.

Yes you can hear country music in the background, but it just feels like you're walking into an everyday bar once you look at the staff and patrons. Can be pretty bad on service too. Not recommended. Drinks are ok though, but nothing amazing."

It happened to be family movie night and there was a huge video playing on a 100 inch screen. - Luckily it was the football game but there still was kids all over the place.  I ordered the half rack - meh.  And their homemade mac n cheese - MEH.   If anything, you should come here just to try out the cookie skillet dessert.  That was delicious.  Other than that, good luck finding the place and enjoy what you can.\n\n-Ian M.  My sole purpose to come here is for oysters and cookie skillet. They are very good!!!\nFresh oysters and the cookie skillet is to die for... I recommend both.  I went for lunch and was seated (at a patio table) immediately. I found the staff to be friendly and efficient. The turkey wrap and steak philly that my husband and I ordered were made perfectly. Outdoor patio on a nice night, and it ended there. I ordered their wings in the house sauce with a side of sweet potato fries. First they fries were cold, I sent them back and 10 minutes later still no fries. I told the waitress to not bother. The wings, deep fried to death... It was like the turkey from Christmas vacation. DRY as sand!!! Avoid this place!  I love eating here! Everything I have tried has been wonderful. I like the BBQ chicken skillet. Very tasty. The best part, however, are the cookie skillets! They have chocolate chip and butterscotch, both are delicious.   The restaurant has a peculiar layout and is dark inside. They do have a patio where you can dine. The food is good but nothing special. Staff seems rushed but attentive to our needs. The owners also have another restaurant very nearby, that operates under the name Afton Pub & Pizza. I think Afton Pub & Pizza has better food and recommend it over Afton Tavern.\n\nParking can be problematic since there are many other businesses and the YMCA nearby.  Don't order the fries. Found a black bug in mine. Manager came by and gave us a $20 Clift card to come back!  Nope never will.  I really like this restaurant! We have been here a handful of times in the past year and have never had a bad experience. The waiting staff has always been friendly and we usually have top-notch service. I love sitting outside near the fireplace when the weather is nice...great atmosphere!\n\nI really enjoy the burgers and the chicken and dumpling soup. Yummy! And although I've never saved enough room for dessert, I have seen the awesome cookie skillet and heard it is delicious! I'll have to remember to go there one day just for the cookie skillet. :)",
        "output": "Looks really nice outside although inside not as nice. Not saying it's bad, just externally more appealing. When it's busy there are too many kids running around though which might annoy some people. Food is so so here, not the best you'll find in town, but good enough. Get sat down really quickly though so not much waiting, but food isn't exactly piping hot when it comes out, so I feel it could be better. Very friendly though."

The Tofu Pad Se Ew tasted like bad chinese hor fun take-out and was extremely salty and spicy (even though I ordered a spicy level of 2 of 5).  The Tofu Pad Se Ew also had a random piece of chicken in it, which was very weird. Had I been a vegetarian I would have been very upset. \n\nEvery other Thai place I'd been too has waaaaay better Pad Se Ew. Stick to this place if you want salty basic/meh chinese type food. I wasn't a big fan of this place for a few years. The food is really good now. This is my 2nd time here, I just had it last weekend. I got jap chap with chicken and green curry with chicken and coconut rice, I couldn't decide which one I wanted. It didn't disappoint. Today I got the saut\u00c3\u00a9ed mango with shrimp and extra coconut rice. I am so glad this place turn itself around. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep it up. Called and asked where I could find a menu online to place a take out order. Was told UrbanSpoon and facebook. Only urbanspoon had a menu and I asked saying it was from 2011 and was told that was right.  When I later called to place the order, the price was $14 more than what the menu on urbanspoon had. I hung up and redid the math and called again.  I was told if I was unhappy with their prices I could go elsewhere, no apology for an employee telling me to find an inaccurate menu online.  I was pretty surprised by the rude customer service.  Great soup especially if you have a cold. Good chicken, vegetable and rice dishes!   Why is it so hard to find good Thai food! Grrrrr. First timer and new to area. \n\nHad the tom yum soup which was just ok. Would not order again. \n\nFor the meal, ordered the drunken noodle. The noodles where not the good fat noodles...but the thin ones. That stinks. Very mild flavor and spice. Try a different dish. \n\nI'm not sure if this restaurant just caters to the American palate but they need more flavor.   Situated at the very end of the sprawling Settlers Ridge shopping/dining complex, this is a decent option for Thai fare. The service is always fast and friendly even during the lunch rush. No bar but they are BYOB friendly. I'm a curry guy and usually get the Massaman with extra veggies and coconut rice. I like it a lot. GrapeWife has tried several dishes and liked them all. The high ceiling in the dining room creates a spacious yet comfortable atmosphere. The round enclosed booth offers some privacy I you're into that. Give them a try. I think you'll be pleased.   It is a nice place, service was great but... we came there to eat pho and it was horrible. Beside that we ordered summer rolls which were pretty good.  My mom and I ordered 3 dishes to share and everything we got was delicious. We ordered the pad this with chicken and tofu the curly fries rice with chicken and shrimp and the honey walnut with chicken. My daughter got the lo mein with chicken and enjoyed it. I was also happy to see they have a changing table in the bathroom( an actual wooden one) great place will definitely be back",

The servers started just putting stuff on random corners of the table were you couldn't reach  (basically, they just dump the food on the table  without consideration of the diners). I think they don't have enough menu choices and all the maki rolls seems to taste the same..bland. Quite disappointed overall.  Terrible service. Small portions. Very slow at bringing food out. Getting confused with our orders. Not worth your money! Went here with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9's cousins. There's so much to choose from with the lunch menu and it came to like 18 dollars. One unique thing is that the pop is AYCE  too! The only complaint is when I ordered tiramisu it was a tiny spoonful. I had to order 4!!  Great spot, enjoyed a wonderful lunch ayce. Sushi was nice, I liked the variety available, and they had more dessert items than usual spots. Definitely want to return here with my wife.\n\nOh and the ambience is great too, nice ordering service to go along with it.  Over priced for the quality they serve. Maybe cuz there's nothing good around this area people come here. Nothing is authentic. Their teriyaki sauce is so weird tasting. Their rice is over vinegar'd. My tongue is still stinging after drinking a whole glass of coke. Thumbs down!  I love this place gali so much. SASHIMI IS FRESH! \nFAST! Nice staff. Great service! Good price! I go there few times a month!   Well, tried many sushi resto in Toronto, compare to the others all u can eat, this is my favourite one, cuz the sashimi and sushi is good, and also the BBQ. I like to go to this resto as its taste is fairly good. Recommend.  This is a brand new sushi restaurant that just opened a few days ago. The service was excellent, the place looks great and inviting as well. \n\nMy brother and I tried the volcano roll which tasted amazing! The AYCE weekend lunch costed about $16.95, it was definitely worth it.",

Not very familiar with the food around town but found this sandwich place and was pleasantly surprised. I recommend the pastrami sub. Very high quality meat, delivered fresh daily, with fresh vegetables. Odd location but fantastic place for lunch.  Definitely a 5 star sandwich joint!\n\nHad the classic italian and wow, was it delicious! Also sampled the pastrami and the flavor was amazing. I really love how soft the bread is as well.\n\nThe service was as good as it gets, and they even asked how we liked it. We felt really \"at home.\" \n\nI really hope this place blows up big time. And I will definitely return.  Small non chain deli, way better than the chains in the area.\n\nThey make a really mean hot pastrami, it is so good that I break my adventurous habits and order it each time.\n\nThe sandwich is a good size for the price.\n\nWork goes here most every Friday and no one has ever had a sandwich that they would complain about.\n\nI love the fact that it is small and non-chain, plus the staff is super happy and friendly.  I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I kept missing their business hours. They extended the hours to 5pm and I made it this time! The sandwiches are HUGE and loaded with flavor. The place was very clean inside and the woman who helped me order was very sweet and informative. I think I found my new sandwich shop! Thank you woods family!  This is one of the better sandwich shops I've been to! It's family owned, which is awesome! I always get the italian when I'm there and my boyfriend gets the joey. It's always clean and the employees are always friendly and very helpful!  Stopped by for lunch while having my car serviced at an auto shop nearby. The sandwich was one of the best I've ever had!  Everything was very fresh and amazing!  It is a tiny bit pricey (which is the only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5), but still worth it. I would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to stop by. Food was good however I was a little disappointed at all the extra \"fees\" on the receipt. .35 cc fee .50 for horseradish .75 for au jus ( that she offered). I would recommend letting people know of all the extra charges BEFORE hand.",

I will definitely return to Battle Blast Laser Tag.  A well run establishment that is great for birthday parties, Battle Blast has a large arena with plenty of targets, easy to use equipment that is in good repair, and several videogames for the kids to collect tickets.  The birthday parties run very smoothly and the pizza is from Seattle Dan's.  I was disappointed in the pizza which appeared to have been reheated or kept in a warmer too long.  The only other food they have is wierd looking sliders and frozen fried foods. However the cake was very good.\n\nThey have plenty of discounted days and pay one price nights.  \nOverall a great place for the kids.  This place is pretty great.  Their unlimited days for $20 is a great deal.  Sometimes people are way too serious about the game we call Laser Tag.  I fell once cause I'm the clumsiest human alive and this man 20 years my senior stood over me and kept shooting at me.... I'm 22. This guy was not a dad - just there.  Regardless, super great place when the creepy men are busy at home watching their computer screens. :) Came here for a birthday party yesterday and my kids had a great time.  \n\n-Staff were great, super friendly and attentive.  \n-Food Pizza & cake was ok\n-Soda unlimited refills ..Their retro soda dispenser is cool\n-Arcade games ok selection. Wish they had more baby friendly games or those .50 rides to keep them occupied\n\n\nLaser Tag\n-Great 2 story lay out!! Honestly the best I've seen yet\n-great equipment\n-Viewing DECK! Love this!  You can see them running around in there through the upstairs viewing deck. Pretty cool  Such a fun place to have a birthday party. They took care of everything, and the kids had a blast. Fun arcade, helpful serving staff, fun for all ages.   Quite easily the best Laser Tag place in the valley.  And by far the coolest arena.  People who work there are totally awesome.  Not to mention they actually keep the place clean.  Great for people of all ages.  Plus they often have specials... such as family play packages, so big families can afford to play.  Tag for tots once a week, and then Wednesday and Friday nights they have all you can play special.  Super Awesome.   Our friends had an excellent birthday party at Battle Blast Laser Tag. For many children, the laser tag games were their first time. The parents felt comfortable. Each child enjoyed the food. Wonderful service.

What a gem! My lashes are so soft, feminine, and natural looking. They totally make my eyes pop! I got my lases done 3 weeks ago and they still look so full. I can't be more satisfied. I definitely will come back to Winnie the next time I visit! I love getting eyelash extensions by Beyond Beauty Lashes! I was introduced to lashes by a good friend of mine that have been coming here for over two years, her lashes looked awsome. I've been coming to Jenny for about 6 months now and refuse to go without lashes which make my eyes look soo pretty. I have volume lashes that are super soft & fluffy. I've never had a problem with them glued stuck together or take any of my natural lashes off. I'm addicted!!! Found their service through Groupon. I scheduled my appointment on Sunday and almost forgot about it. I went to get my lashes done hungry-as in starving since I woke up late. The whole time Jenny was doing my lashes my stomach was growling. I mean, all I can think of was food and donuts they had for the customers.\n\nIt took about 45 mins and my lashes was awesome. Jenny was friendly and professional. Will get my fill next time. They were awesome. Okay, my ramen is here- time to eat.  I wish there were an option to give ZERO stars!! This company has a terrible product, and even worse customer service! They made a mistake on my lashes, and admitted it, yet will not correct their mistake nor refund me. You are better off throwing your money in the street and having a child apply eyelash extensions than to visit this business.  I absolutely love this place. I've been going consistently for over 6 months and have never left unsatisfied. I always ask for Winnie, she's great! Everyone is skilled there and I highly recommend them. Since I've been going to them I haven't put on one ounce of mascara, you won't need it and you will still look fabulous, trust me. Thanks Beyond Beauty Lashes!!! Xuan and Jenny are very sweet and are very good at what they do. If you have any concerns or questions as far as your lashes they are there to help. The experience is relaxing and peaceful.

The Italian Sodas are a perfect combination to the hearty bowl!! This is the worst piada i have been to. They were out of several ingredients and shorted me on the ones they did have. There avocado was way over ripe and there salsa was mush. The servers paid no attention to my order and had to correct them numbers of times. Will never be returning here and do not recommend If chipotle had a stupid Italian cousin it would be this place. There food is awkward.  I've come here a few times before and never had an issue until tonight. The staff was rude, the store was out of several ingredients key to several of their offerings. They moved super slow. It was overall disappointing.   Disappointed. Plus, we were waiting in line and the electricity went completely out. I went to A Piada a few years back and it seemed way better then. Feel like it's gone down hill since the first time I visited.  Pointless to order on line,  staff unapologetic for delay.  Order was to be ready at 3:45 it is now 4:03 and is still being prepared.  Should have gone to the Beachwood location  Was curious about this place.  Pasta was hot and tasty.  Menu was complicated and difficult to navigate.  It would take a few visits to get it right.  Being from out of town, I don't know that we will seek it out next time.   I used to love Piada, but this particular location is abysmal. On two separate occasions now I've not been greeted when I entered. Now, even if you are busy, anyone with half an ounce of experience with food service etiquette should know to at least greet the customer, and if necessary, let them know you will be right with them.

Nothing was comped on the bill which i find pretty absurd....   Food is decent, and the drinks are ok. Not a hugh selection, but not bad either. The staff can be a little salty though.   As a teacher you would think I would love this place and it was nice that the food was named after books. But the place was Full I mean full of hipsters.

I could say the dragon and rock and roll were among my most favorite ones but the veggies was probably the least favorite. We went on a surprise date to a new place.   They were totally packed and had 2 servers on. Maybe a call off and that happens. But our server could barely get to us and just dropped food and ran. If she really looked, she would have seen we didn't eat one sushi roll.  The Dean. Pureed and super fishy. \n\nThe Udon Noodles seemed Way over cooked. Wine list was crap, but I wasn't expecting anything great. \n\nWe left hungry and will not return because of the food. I can forgive some slow service.  I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it.  Not sure if I hit them on an off night, but the sushi was not good.  I sure hope this isn't the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Didn't care for the atmoshphere...kind of dingy.  Stunningly bad...

The green tea is made with leaves and not tea bags which is a nice change of pace.\n\nWin.  Sushi with great mouthfeel, well-executed rice, but not a ton of flavor.\n\nI ordered the Sushi deluxe meal, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri (fish on top of rice, which is the only sushi in Japan.) This comes with miso soup and the common sesame ginger salad. The miso soup was flat in flavor and the salad was OK. A bit too much sweetness/acidity from the dressing.\n\nThe sushi selection was predictable. Tuna, salmon, snapper, and bbq eel. The fish was very creamy in mouthfeel (excellent) but none of them impressed me in flavor except the bbq eel, which was smoky and sweet. Rice was of good execution.
