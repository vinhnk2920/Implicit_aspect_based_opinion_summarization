    "Went on a Friday evening, business looks like it's booming, Food was DELICIOUS! They made adjustments to our order request with no problem, we ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice dishes. Did I mention my food was delicious?!!",
    "I just want to say thank you!  The team was quick and efficient!  I was very pleased with the work they did and I will definitely call them back to work for me again!",
    "I prefer not to write negative. However, I have had four experiences at Worker Bee since I first yelped about them in May of 2013. The food is tasty, but the service ?? The service is lacking something terrible. I really hope ownership can turn it around. I understand busy and that's cool, but it's not called the \"service industry\" for nothing. You got to acknowledge your customers even if you're gonna make then wait 40/50 minutes for their order....",
    "I think this is a pea-shake house. They never seem to be open and they never return calls. This is twice now that I have attempted to reach them.",
    "The moment you try to cancel service, be prepared to go through hell. You cannot talk to anyone, nobody will help you. AVOID this company like the plague.",
    "BEST BANH MI IN THE CITY. The sandwiches are only $3 (can't be beaten)!!! They are large, overflowing with vegetables and packed with flavor. I'm addicted to this place.",
    "Such a shame I have to give this diner only one star but it's what the truly deserve. Came in around 8:30 on a Monday, sat and waited at my table until 9:05 until I had to leave. All of the working staff stood by the monitors and completely ignored my table. The place was not busy at all- in fact it was dead. Had to bring my menus up and drop them off to the hostess, I didn't even get a water during my time here.",

    "Haircuts are ok. Staff is unfriendly and unprofessional. Almost every time I've been to this store I hear several of the girls making fun of customers after they leave. They tell you to sit down and they'll check you in but they never come to check you in and they will try to check people in that walked in after you. There are a couple girls here who are really good, but overall I am not impressed with this place.",
    "I wish I was able to review the salons services BUT I didn't retain any. I had a 10am appointment with Carlos that has been booked for 3 weeks. I arrived at the salon 10 minutes early to be greeted by the receptionist who told me she would grab Carlos for me. \n\nMeanwhile clients are walking in being taken right away, I sit and wait until 10:35. I asked the receptionist what's going on and she told me that Carlos was still with a client- 30 minutes after my scheduled appt time. \n\n1. Don't book a schedule you can't handle. \n2. The receptionist should have advised me of Carlos running late\n3. Don't go to this salon as they are unorganized and unprofessional.\n\nAnd what's the worst is that I had prepaid for this hair service on Groupon so now I am out my money.",
    "This review is solely for the wax/esthetician. If you want a quick and dirty brazilian, then go here. I went one time, was walked into the room and paying the bill within 8 minutes. I felt weirdly violated in a way. The things that bothered me was that the esthetician was blowing on the wax, which felt unsanitary. Then after she was done, she just left the room. I was not offered a mirror to check out the job and she didn't tweeze any remnants she missed. So to pay 50$ for a less than 5 minute service felt like a complete rip off.",
    "I used to dine here all the time with my friends for dinner and BYOB and it was amazing. But now apparently there's a $20 corking fee?!... $20 is the price of an entree here!! Also now they don't serve any bread or crackers with the cheese platters unless you specifically ask. Not impressed",
    "The email that they provide to customers to write to them, not in the systematic .I try to send an email and this was constantly rejected by the system. I'm not sure if the product they offer \"Patriot Power Green\" is real.",
    "This place is great!  Just had the Lomo sandwich and it was very enjoyable and will definitely bring me back.  \nThe owners, Martin and Miriam, were extremely nice and helpful. They obviously take pride in what they do.\nDidn't really know what to expect but I'm happy we tried it.",
    "If I am going to spend this amount of coin on plants, I may as well head to terrain in glens mills and get the customer service that is attached to the price tag.  I felt as if I did them a disservice by even popping in. Sorry guys, I thought you wanted to sell something.",
    "Just on my yelp account and saw this review.  Just wanted to update that my friend bought this vehicle from me and it is still running fine without the work Honda said I needed,",
    "I have been going to Massage Green since it opened. The experience of the business is always great. Friendly, quiet and peaceful. I highly recommend Brooke, Todd and Angel as therapists. You won't be disappointed! It's always easy to get an appointment within 24-48 hours.",
    "I had the chicken korma- it was the worst I've ever had. Don't be fooled by their description like me, there were no cashews or almonds or cilantro and it wasn't creamy. The kheer it was also runny and had no flavor.",
    "I was met by a person chomping on her gum,not looking at me or telling me if I was okay with my insurance, appointment or anything.  I stood there like a deer in the head lights.",
    "Do not switch because its cheaper. Dealing with them is absolutely brutal. Enough said! How does this company stay in business! What a joke!\nThey will not pick 1 thing up other than your can.\nFor a xmas bonus im gonna piss in my can and hope it gets all over the truck. Do the job I pay you for!!!!!!! I cant wait to switch company's.",
    "Can I give a zero? We were ignored the 10 min we were there so we left.  There is no indication for folks not from around here how to order...that's not customer service.",
    "If I could give zero stars, I would. BAIT AND SWITCH. I got a phone call confirming my appointment 2 hours before I was supposed to go drive a car I have been looking for for months. When I got in, the salesman goes \"oooh you guys are going to hate me\" because OF COURSE it sold an hour ago, right?? Bullshit. That car was long gone and they let me come in anyway. Bonus: it's still on their website. Bunch of sheisters. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",
    "My husband and I were excited to try Candicci's. We walked in and it smelled delicious. That's where it all ended. We were  taken to our table, given menus, and told our server would be right with us. Well, that was a joke. 10 minutes of just sitting there, with not a soul acknowledging us, we got up to leave. As we were leaving a server asked if we'd been helped, but it was too little too late. We won't go back, there's no excuse for that kind of neglect. Especially when it wasn't that busy. Four servers just hanging out by the bar, I just don't understand.",
    "Food = 4 stars \n\nService = 0 stars (forgot about part of our order and seemed to have forgotten about us after a while, despite the restaurant being half-full)\n\nAtmosphere = 1 star (ambiance was very pleasing, however, the killer was that it was freezing cold and no one even acknowledged it - guess patrons wearing their jackets and scarfs didn't give it away?!?!)\n\nWas really excited about going, but ended up being pretty disappointed.....",
    "Damn, I wanted to be the first one to review this statue. \n\nThis is a statue of the protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's masterpiece \"A Confederacy of Dunces.\"  Jeff S's review sets the scene and I agree that the representation isn't nearly fat enough. \n\nThis statue is to be found on Canal between Bourbon and Dauphine. It seems there is another Chateu Sonesta hotel on Bourbon and Iberville; some internet sites will lead you to this location and make you walk around the hotel looking for it, like an idiot, as happened to me.",
    "I can not recommend them more. They are truly the best!! They DO NOT price gouge! They are honest and reliable.  I will not go any where else!!",
    "Love the fact that they made me turn my hat forward before sitting down. Crab fries were good but not awesome. Id probably go again just because the location is such a Philadelphia staple - but I won't roll into the city and go, \"YO - I need to go to Chickie's And Pete's!\"",
    "Not impressed! Went in for a refill. Amy, the technician was extremely rough, cut me twice and kept pulling my hands. I asked for coffin shape and they looked square, I explained how I wanted them, so she filed a little more, but they still came out looking square and also much shorter than I wanted from all the filing. After less than 24 hours a nail started to come off. I went back and she fixed it again very roughly. She picked a color that was close to my shade but not exact and insisted it was the same. I will not be returning!",
    "I have been there two times. The staff in the range is very nice and experienced, but one of the staff in the store isn't that friendly.",
    "I considered this the best KBBQ in Philly right now. The food, the service, and the atmosphere are great! \n\nSet A is more than enough for 2 people. The quality of meat is good, and I love the side dishes they offered. \n\nThe waiter was super nice and accommodating. They regularly checked on you and helped you grill the meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is very modern but still cozy. The restaurant is very new so I love how I did not smell like bbq food on me. \n\nI will definitely come back here again.",
    "Italian Wedding Soup is one thing and Matzo Ball Soup is another; combining the two.....is a no-no, but it was Tasty..\n\nGetting around Town has been getting more and more difficult, lately.\n\nWhen Lox, Bagel and Cream Cheese, FINALLY, make it to the Menu....i will crawl up to The Deli; until then.........wish they had Bialys.....kvetch, kvetch, kvetch.\n\nMaybe, i should have some Soup and Shut up!\n\nTheir Corn Beef is to die for; try it, you'll like it!!!",
    "If you're looking to spend $110 for an arrangement that looks like a $20 grocery store arrangement, then this florist is for you. \nMy dad bought my mom flowers for Mother's Day. What a joke! We will never order from them again. Save your money and buy flowers from Costco. \n\nThey don't deserve one star, but unfortunately I had to give them one.",
    "This place is just average in terms of hibachi. I had the chicken hibachi and it was good. I would recommend it. The fried rice is some of the best I've had. I did not like the salad dressing. I am not a fan of Mayo and it tasted exactly like that. The miso soup was fair too. Nothing special. The sushi is absolutely amazing and even if I didn't come back for hibachi I'd come back for sushi over and over again!! It was fantastic!!!",
    "What can I say, this is my home away from home.  I spend my days and nights here.  Working during the day as a research assistant and working at night as a student.  \n\nWhat's nice about the location is how close the lake actually is and sometimes it's nice to be able to just walk across the campus and take a stroll.",
    "I just had to upgrade this place as they have Hop Notch IPA from Uinta Brewing Company on tap, a very highly rated IPA.  YUM!!!!\n\nTuna appetizer is still above average, wings are average.  Also, I do believe their prices are reasonable. \n\nThe women behind the bar are the best. ;-)",
    "I usually go to plaza but this is closer to me. \nThey are generally not helpful at this location . \nI've been twice and I will make the trip to plaza in the future .",
    "These guys are scam artists! They came to fix a leak in my system. They do not give you any estimate. They just start working on the problem. Then they send you a bill in the mail. If you ask them how much it will cost they just repeat that they will send you a bill in the mail. They fixed the problem but they charge way too much. Their minimum charge is around $95! Buyer beware!",
    "I really hate when doctors are in a hurry and treat you like you're a number for as much as we  pay they should treat you better.   It's just a moneymaking machine not the doctors office",
    "Not fond of this place at all.  My friends and I thought we were going to a place were we could have a drink and enjoy some music. That was not the case. The music was so loud we could not even talk. We tried the food and it was absolutely terrible. Nothing but fried. The drinks were even worse.  The drink specials were either too sweet or not strong enough.  So beer was all we could drink.  I don't won't to forget to mention the service was bad too.\n\nWe will not go back.  It was definitely not worth the money we spent.",
    "Had lunch here with my son, We both ordered burgers and a shake. The shake was delicious. I have to say we overheard the delivery person say something about that is how his grandmother scrapes off the burnt on the bun when it is burnt. That would be my son's burger. When we finished I asked for a slice of carrot cake to go. The woman took the chef's knife that he cuts chicken and burgers with sliced the cake, and then wiped it off with the rag she cleans the tables and counter with. Enough said.",
    "I love these people! My son was going to college in SB and I had to trust they would make sure his jeep was in working order. They helped him out and for the price they were honest and got the job done. Now he is going to San Diego for school and I have to find some one I can trust like Ayers.",
    "Definitely do bot go here if you are a POC. It's sad that we still have to experience racism in business establishments in this day and age. The staff needs to be screened thoroughly!",
    "After hearing all about five guys forever, being called the in n out of the East Coast I had to try it. Let's just say it's not in n out, not even close. This place is disgusting. The burgers were all soggy and could not be eaten. The  place was dirty.  And the workers were all stoned. Horrible!",
    "I bought a groupon for this restaurant on the fly as I was leaving work.  When I came home I read the reviews stating that they charged $2 and an 18% gratuity for anyone using a groupon.  This is mentioned nowhere on groupon or their website (which seems to be consistently down).\n\nSo, I thought I would go ahead and call to find out if that was indeed true.  \"Hello, I just purchased a groupon for your restaurant, but I read a couple of reviews on yelp stating that you charge folks $2 and an 18% gratuity just for using a groupon?\"  \"It is for taxes,\" says the woman on the line, \"It is the same for everyone.\"  \"That wasn't my question,\" I said.  \"So it's true then?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I'll have to cancel that one, then.   Thanks.\"\n\nI promptly called groupon support and cancelled that groupon.  Don't let this place get away with that swindle.",
    "I got a notice stating my preorder was ready to be picked up from the store. When I got to the store, Jared tells me I cannot pick up the order because its not released yet. He was holding the movie in his hand but would not let me pick it up. I tried explaining that in the past, I have always been able to pick up my preorder when they were ready. Instead of trying to figure out a solution, he repeats that the item is not released yet and tells me to come back tomorrow. Why would you tell a customer the order would be ready to pick up if I clearly cannot? Thanks for wasting my time and gas, Best Buy.",
    "Actually conversation.\nME: I ordered a wheel buffing kit on November 6th, I have yet to receive it.\n\nEastwood: give me your tracking number\n\nME: actually you did not provide me with a tracking number and since you are the shipper, you should have the tracking number for me?\n\nEastwood: Can I get the invoice number?\n\nME: yes its \"1111111\"\n\nEastwood: ok its shows your package is at the post office, you can go pick it up in Delray\n\nME; Ok, ill need the tracking number and which post office?, there are several in Delray Beach.\n\nEastwood: well I do not have tracking number, but just go to the post office its there.\n\nME: Ah without a tracking number, thats like showing up to the dentist, when you've made a reservation for dinner at Red Lobster.\n\nEastwood: Ok we will send you another one...",
    "This place is closed permanently! Very sad as I was really looking forward to their donuts. They've been gone about a month according to the business across the street.",
    "I was working in town for a month and being from LV I like to stop in casino I would say this is the closest to a LV casino in New Orleans. I like the location I could walk to most of the downtown sights or take a horse drawn carriage. Make sure and wear your mask. The machines aren't any tighter or looser than in LV.",
    "I ordered Uber Eats because my delivery was taking awhile and I couldn't leave my truck so pulled up the app then selected this place!  Muy Delicioso!",
    "Went here to take the grandkids for some pizza and arcade games. \nI wasn't that impressed...the tables needed some cleaning, and it seemed like it took a while to get the pizzas. \nStaff was courteous.\nThe pizzas themselves were OK, but for the price I'd rather go over to the gourmet pizza place on Los Altos.",
    "Customer service is terrible. With all the options a consumer has., Why would one go to this location?! Customer service is terrible. \nI pay for a service and never really get it.. what's wrong with this picture.",
    "So I went to Rooms To Go and purchase a king size mattress and box spring and it was supposed to be $987 plus tax. I use their Acceptance Now program which they did not disclose all of the fees they were charging me. While I was there filling out the paperwork for acceptance now the guy that I was dealing with Braden came and told the acceptance now guy to add the mattress protector and I asked them if the mattress protector cost any money and he said no it was included in the 987 plus tax. Come to find out they charge me an extra 69. 99. If you choose to shop here be careful when signing things because they are tricky and a scam.",
    "Just left the hospital from having surgery. Everyone was so nice and helpful. They even had room service. Have never been treated better at a hospital. Highly recommended.",
    "I rescued one of my three from Five Acres, I was so impressed with the passion of these people, and their concern for animal welfare that I signed up to be a volunteer.",
    "Outstanding coffee- Agent Cooper would be delighted.\nTheir salads and sandwiches look amazing, too.  \n\nFor those in or from the Bay Area, Gia Pronto somewhat reminds me of Mixt Greens on Bush Street (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mixt-greens-san-francisco), but with sandwiches and coffee.\n\nI'll definitely be back.",
    "Cenlar technically receives no star from me. I only gave one star so I could post this. They should be put out of business by whomever enforces them.  Charged me a $200 fee to close out an interest balance of .73.",
    "Andrew, the manager contacted me to clarify the mistake with our bill.  He handled it so professionally, I really appreciated that!  Can't beat a business that takes the time to contact their customers and fix their mistakes!",
    "They are too inconsistent with there food but we keep trying, bought 2 chicken cheese steaks and they had beef mixed in plus we purchased onion rings which are normally good but they where burnt we should have taken then back but they never should have let them leave the shop like that.",
    "Another 2-10 Warranty customer. Called in an order and was assigned this company. The fan is not turning in the AC, so it shuts down automatically. This in 100 degree heat. 2-10 labeled our call \"Emergency\" and when George's called, they told us they could be out in 4 days. When I said that wasn't going to work, they shortened it to 3 days. Given how 2-10s systems work, you're damned if you do (switch to another contractor and possibly lose the Friday date) and damned if you don't (wait it out and see if George's shows up on Friday). \n\nNot happy with either company right now.",
    "I have eaten at Ellen's three times.  The two times that I have eaten there for breakfast there was a female that was responsible for  making the sandwiches, working the register and getting drinks.  Not once did she wash her hands or change the one glove after taking money, making coffee, or getting drinks.  If  you are going to work the register and make sandwiches, PLEASE wash your hands.",
    "Really like this place!   First I had a Groupon, but i still going back... I  love the shape of my eyebrows. The place is very clean and cute. Will continue to go there!",
    "AVOID THIS COMPANY !!!!!\n\nDriver was rude, argumentative, generally hostile and in such a hurry his crew broke two pieces of furniture just taking them off the truck.\n\nWhen we discovered a box was missing and asked for help locating it, the driver said, \"I don't have time for this (expletive deleted).\"\n\nIn short, Bekins will lose your stuff; they will break your stuff and they truly don't care.",
    "Not honest and not trustworthy.  Sad to say, I would never use this company again.   Too bad people are this way.  Life is too short to have to take advantage of people the way you do.  If there were zero stars, that would be my rating.",
    "Eddie gave me the deal I was suppose to get from lying Frank. Eddie owns the sleep shoppe/santa barbara county sleep shoppes. He gave me what Frank could not. Go see Ortho, then see Eddie, you'll be glad you did!",
    "I was helped immediately by Tom who was courteous and registered my dog quickly with his Nevada tag.  Now, if my dog gets lost and scanned for his microchip, they have my number and address.  Because he is neutered and up to date on his rabies vaccine, it only cost $8.\nOn Longley Lane close to the airport.",
    "The best!  We picked up a one pound box mix of pralines and tortues for my parents and these were just delicious.  The staff was so friendly.  Highly recommend.",
    "we love this store because the employees are always very helpful in finding anything your looking for. It's never to crowded to shop. You can go in this store and now where everything is very easily without searching through every isle to find something.",
    "This is the former Remedes, located in Renown Medical Center. Atmosphere is open, airy and pleasant. Service is efficient and very pleasant. Food is well prepared, presented quite nicely and very good.\nPrices aren't inexpensive($29.08 for two), but it's worth it, especially for a hospital location. They also do catered events within this location.\nIf you are hungry, at the hospital, you could grab some food here and not be disappointed.",
    "***They automatically include tip into your check!***\n\nWhat I ordered: \nChicken and Waffles\n\nUncle Bill's open 24 hours!?!  To be honest, I dream of this place every time I go out at night.  In Saint Louis, it's hard to find a place that is open late at night, especially one with quality food.  However, not only does this place have breakfast food whenever you want, but it also has chicken and waffles!  \n\nThey'll split the checks for you, but they do include tip already.  \n\nI'll definitely be coming back here whenever I can.",
    "I had this company come to check my furnace that wasn't working... He gave me an estimate for $1600 plus a fee of $98 for coming out. Had another company do much better on price",
    "Would not do business with these guys.  I have dealt with car salesmen before but some of these guys take the cake, especially that Shultz guy they brought in. \nBe very careful if you choose to do business over there.  They will undervalue you your car and embarrass you into thinking that your car is worthless and that they are doing you a favor to take it off of your hands.",

Their cheesesteaks are outstanding with my waistline expanding,\nI saw the sandwich and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sandwich. No one's gonna drag you up to get into the line where you belong.

    "I didn't use these guys, but let me tell you why. I was quoted $95 per hour with a 2 hour minimum. Then, if I needed a truck it was $145 for the day plus $1.15 per mile. This is insane to charge for a truck.  Not to mention I would have to drive the truck. I ended up going with Carneys",
    "This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to! The employees are rude, unhappy and act like you're doing them a favor by shopping there. I will be shopping at the Natural Grocers from now on. Forget this place!!!",
    "The service department is awful. My service rep advised me that it would take two weeks to perform a recall service on my daughters car. \n\nWhen I called after 16 days they had not touched it. They hadn't even done a diagnostic on it. Two days later they told me that the vehicle didn't fall within the recall mileage frame. \n\nWhen I asked then why they didn't tell us this when we brought the car in I was told that the service rep (Giovanni) was new and he should have known better. \n\nI spoke with the service manager. He's a joke too. His name is Darrell. \n\nBe sure to get any agreement in writing before committing to service with this business.",

I asked for one that had not been dropped on the counter and she obliged while rolling her eyes. I then saw her put the dropped cupcake back in the case. That just doesn't seem sanitary to me.",
    "Wow, the quality of food has dropped. When they first opened I would always order from them. Now I don't know who is running the place anymore but it's just really bad!!!!",

    "Daaaaammmmmmnnnn. Their service is fast. I ordered a \"Gyro Pita\" with feta cheese, went to take a seat and LITERALLY got called to pick it up a minute later. \n\nSweet heyzeus. This gyro was ungodly good. The meat wasn't too salty or overly seasoned; it was also juicy without being too greasy. The toppings were fresh and sumptuous. I basically inhaled this in two minutes. \n\nThis place is a must if you love gyros as much as I do.",

    "Rating on the service center. I made a 7 am appointment for a recall repair and was told it would require 1 hour. I was not told about the night drops being placed on the \"when we get to it\" list. At noon I called to see when the vehicle would be done and was told 2 pm because i didn't stipulate when i needed the car by. What is the point of an appointment if it is not honored? \nI'll be heading back to the dealership in Burlington when I need service done.",
    "I used to love this place. The fried rice is to die for. \n\nOne time I ordered scallops and steak and they only gave my scallops by accident. When I asked for my steak, they scooped half my scallops in the trash!! I was so upset that they made the mistake and they still scraped half my food in the garbage. \n\nI returned once more after that because like I said, the rice is unbelievable. But this time the ladies sitting next to me spotted cockroaches crawling in and out of the grill! Both instances, the staff was rude and suddenly did not speak English anymore when I tried to complain. I will never go back there again.",
    "Came here for drinks, chips and guacamole before heading to dinner. Guacamole was $15 and although good, it only came with three tostados. When I asked for extra they brought 3 more and charged an additional $3. They have some guts charging that much and for that alone I will never come back. $50 for two drinks and 4 ounces of guacamole you can have it.",
    "I'm glad that I met this doctor because now I know how to spot a quack. All she does is refer you to specialists and send you off on your way. \n\nOur healthcare system is the pits and she is one of the reasons why. She's nice and pleasant but she doesn't do anything at all! Not a thing.  \n\n(Note: I tried to post without any stars and I couldn't. I so wish I could take this star back.)\n\nIf you make an appointment because you aren't feeling well it'll be a waste of your time. If you need someone to write referrals this is the place.

When they said there is no worries on the battery because it's under warranty I was sold, so made the purchase (accuvape v-stick av battery). 15 days later (today) it stops working (fully charged and no lights or voltage).

    "DO NOT waste your time. I was pre-approved again and again by this company over a 6 month period. Then, I proceeded to be passed off from one person to another as 2 employees left without notice. 3 days before closing, I was told via email that I was denied for a mortgage that was 50% less than what I was originally approved for. I could not go to closing and ultimately lost the property. No one called to apologize. No one followed up. No one cared.",
    "They lost the ticket for our order.. they don't give refunds. We waited 2 hours plus. The food was mediocre. Seriously no refunds after a two hour wait?! This used to be my go to po-boy spot. Never again. Oh and there is nothing Irish about the bar. The bar tenders are good. They have umbrellas on their ceiling, but that doesn't help customer service. Don't recommend esp during parades.",

    "Looking for something fun to do by the river walk? Try out the water bikes! It's definitely a workout, but worth it to see the views from the water side.\n\nWe booked and reserved our bikes online, i believe there is a discount if you do book online, but do not take my word for it. You have the option to have the bikes for 1 hour or 2. Honestly, 1 was good enough for me. Lol. There is no way you will tip over in the bike and there is a basket that will keep your belongings dry. The instructor will provide the instructions for you and areas you are allowed to go to. Very simple and easy. Just make sure you stay aware of boats, paddle boards, kayaks around you. Pretty sure you won't ever bump into them and boats are not allowed to go fast on the river as well. So you'll be safe. \n\nYou have the option to either bike alone or with a tandem. I'm glad i did the tandem with my husband, cause I'm pretty sure i would've given up if i was by myself. Haha.",
    "The food maybe good... But the service sucks. They are not prepared for any size group nor are they pleasant.   \n\nWe called up front to let them know a group was arriving.  They don't give a rats a$&!\n\nGO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!",
    "I have to say that I was not at all impressed or pleased with Karen's Kleaning.  The staff was friendly but they did not clean well.  For instance, the bathroom....  They cleaned only one vanity sink even though both were being used.  They did not scrub/clean the shower or the shower glass door, which was covered with water spots.  They completely skipped over the jet bath tub which was dusty because we don't use it since the drought alert in California.  There were still cobwebs in corners, and all this in ONE bathroom.  This pretty much set the tone for the rest of their cleaning diligence for the rest of the house.  We will not be using them again.  I use myself as the cleaning standard and they fell far short of that to my disappointment.",

Once we were in the store, my daughter wanted to use the restroom but to our surprise there wasn't one; but did notice an employee sitting in the store smoking. Yes smoking in the store where they are serving food. We immediately left the store because they didn't seem to care that he was sitting in the store smoking. Is this the norm here??",
    "Well just called Summit shopping center & Got Pho is closed!  Currently they are in negotiations ( of what?) so who know if they will reopen. Sign on door says 'closed for transformations' or something to that extent. Guess the owners finally got caught serving crap for hi $$",
    "I was shocked and appalled tonight when my girlfriend and I tried to have drinks at Dannys. She has a 7 pound service dog who is certified with papers and a register number. Mo was bartending and refused to serve us while she called Richard, the owner of the bar. She then came back and told us that service dogs are not allowed. We were told to come back tomorrow and talk to the owner. I am shocked. This is a first and it's absolutely disgusting. Tomorrow the ACLU will be contacted, however, be warned that if you have a service dog: YOU WILL NOT BE SERVED at Dannys. Such a disappointment.",
    "Sent mechanic that left the back of my boat completely dismantled.  Also, broke one of my latches and found hose clamps broke.  Michael, quoted me no more than $400 but yet, charged me a service plus $400 plus tax.  I will never use these guys again. Make sure to get everything in writing if you do choose as their word means nothing",

    "Took my dogs there, they stayed for 6 nights.  They came back pretty light, I guess they were a little scared to eat.  The people were nice enough, the price was affordable.  It was clean enough for a kennel.\n\nRemember this is a kennel, I suggest somewhere else if you want your dogs to be pampered.  If you want someone to keep your dogs alive and well, K9 Designs works.",

    "Dr. Gratz is the best.  My wife and I have been going to him for 2 years.  Making appointments is never an issue and I've never waited more than 10 minutes or so.  Dr. Gratz always seems interested in finding the core of the problem not just pumping you with meds.  \n\nHe's very easy to talk to.  I've been through a lot of doctors and have never had one that made me feel at ease like Dr. Gratz does.",
    "First of all, the people that work there are very nice. I chatted with them and they were totally awesome. Some of the clothes were nice, but way too rich for my blood. However, they had some items on sale, like men's suits for $100! Problem is, I'm a girl.",

    "The Bagel and coffee were both really great! The place was designed a little oddly though. Felt like a mix of the salon and a coffee place! \n\nRegrettably the server was quite rude to me. No idea why but had to put it in here.\n\nStopped by this place after visiting Lafayette Cemetery #1",
    "Visited this location with two of my coworkers for brunch one day. I ordered the King Crab Benny with a mimosa. Also got the potatoes, Otis style. Food was so delicious! The mimosa was just alright. I thought it was pretty pricey for something so small. For 3 meals and 3 drinks, it came out to about $75 not including tip.",
    "I have been waiting an hour and a half. Staff could care less and never bothered to let me know they were running late. I should bill them!",

    "Too pricey. Menu was not great. Staff was good and attentive. Watch your wallet on this one. Food was cooked well, but not for the price.\nShould be called \"first to Ignore\" when eating out.",
    "First, I need to apologize for not remembering to post my review sooner. The 3 movers who arrived to move my storage unit were amazing. I was really impressed with their service and how fast they've loaded and unloaded the content of my 10x30 unit. They all worked so hard and with a smile on their faces from start to finish, so respectful and professional! Absolutely 5 stars experience!",
    "I bring my two girls here for vet care. They are the best. I have seen Dr. Lent and Dr. Quick. They are two vets that really care about the animal and not just the money. They take the time to listen to you. The staff was very nice too. I would highly recommend them to anyone.",

    "I am new to, so this was an experience. However I thoroughly enjoyed that education and atmosphere of this place. At first I was a little intimidated because I felt a little awkward and out-of-place when I walked in. however the guy behind the bar David directed me to Alexia who took the time to explain everything to me. she told me about Papa and gave me a sample. she also told me about all of the cheese that they offer. I also got to sample the Kava and some t. I also bought a coffee and a tea 2 Go. it was a ton of information but I thoroughly enjoyed every second and learned a lot period I cannot wait to go back. and I'm super excited to know that they have a location in Madeira Beach as well.",
    "Oh hell yeah, KAJUN'S!!!\n\nNow THIS is a place where you can get wasted and not worry about embarrassing yourself.\n\nThis place gets five stars even though I once got pepper sprayed in the face by the bartender when she was trying to get a crustpunk who was sitting next to me to gtfo.",
    "One star is being nice! This place is a joke. Over charged me for 2 pizzas so I called to speak to a manager and she told me it depends on who takes your order on what the price is! I was livid and asked if that sounds logical? Then the manger hung up on me twice!!! NEVER ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE!!! Who knows what price they'll charge you!",
    "Always a treat. The service is great. The nail techs are kind and patient and very detailed. They serve you tea or mimosas. And they are very clean and prepared for each customer. I highly recommend this nail salon.",

    "Very disappointed. Girls in the back are lazy. If it weren't for the girls in the back I could of walked out with my gun but they have a set time they stop running backgrounds which is fine but I have my CCW and they didn't want to do the work 30 minutes before closing because they are lazy. I suggest when gun shopping SNG on palo verde they will work pass the time to get you out with your gun!",

    "Went to the salad bar yesterday in the middle of the day.  I believe the salad bar is supposed to close at 9pm.  However at around 6pm 1/2 of the salad bar had been taken down.  I asked someone at the deli about this, she was polite and went to get the gentleman that was in charge of the salad bar. He came out shrugged his shoulders, chuckled and said \"No, I'm not refilling it \" turned around and walked away. I stood there for a second shocked by his I don't give a \"F\" attitude. I left and went to Acme.",

    "If I could give this place no stars I would.\nToday is my birthday and still couldn't get a bartender over to where I was sitting so I could get a drink.

    "STAY AWAY! The sales guy will call you & try to be Mr Nice Guy & say he's going to send you a sample to try & then Invoice you for the product - IT IS A SCAM! You'll notice on their website there is no place to order online, there's a reason for that...so he can scam you",
    "Nice clean and cozy.  The girl on the counter was pleasant.  The food is very good and tasty.  Sits a block away from the Camden Aquarium so it is a place you should visit if you are stopping by the Aquarium.",
    "There is a $99 service call which I found out is the highest in Boise. Then the service guy tells me it will be over $400 to replace my control board. Sounds serious  enough right? So I pay it only to later find out the board is a $70 part and it took him less than a hour to replace. Grrrr I am so mad at these people for taking advantage of me.",
    "What's below a 1 Star? Why won't the Nurse answer my call or return my messages? I just want my questions answered in regard to a procedure the DR. Wants to perform. They are very adamant to not allow any communication with the Dr. or Nurse. I've never been treated like this. This is my body/health we are speaking of. What happened to \"Healthcare\". GO ELSEWHERE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!",
    "My coworkers and I decided to give Wild Garlic another shot at lunch since the pizza is yummy and it's close to the office.  Sadly, the service is still exceptionally slow.  We sat ourselves and we had to flag someone down to get our drink orders.  It took 45 minutes for our Garlic Knots appetizer to arrive and then she came back promptly with our 3 slices.  At this point we were starving so we inhaled it but were still late to the office coming back from lunch.  The food is great but with the service being slow, Wild Garlic probably won't make it into our lunch rotation.",
    "I was recommended to call them, but they never answer their phones and the phone line on the website for the support groups - what I was looking for - has actually been disconnected. That is no way to do business of any kind.",

Ashley is super awesome and good with extensions and Maggie is super great as well!",

    "I would highly recommend this place plenty of times in the past so please read before you think I am a nay sayer\n\nI used to break a sweat and love my PepperFire and their Tender Royal. It seems though something was surely lost along the way as my friend and I got two today. The grilled cheese was very bland and his Hot and my XHot were barely noticeable in terms of heat. I enjoy the pain/love that comes with eating Hot chicken and it just was NOT THERE! The chicken tenders also were barely that of my thumb in length or circumference. These things could have passed for chicken nuggets. I was about to just ask for my money back it was that bad. My friend and I were both surprised at the lack of heat and of size of the meat portions. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come or I'm headed elsewhere.",

And keep in mind that a \"one hour\" massage is really more like 45 minutes. I can't wait til I can cancel my contract.",
    "This place is awesome and does not disappoint!! My daughter and I drove to Vampire Penguin on a Monday during the day the week before school started. I heard about them on the Palm Harbor Happenings Facebook page.\n\nTheir shaved ice is so light and creative. The staff was extremely friendly.  I got the tuxedo which is chocolate shaved ice with strawberries and marshmallows.  My daughter got the pina colada which had pineapple and coconut shavings.  WOW they were both delicious.  We both got a small which was plenty for us.  We will definitely be back.\n\nPlease build another one in Palm Harbor!",

I did not like the taste of the pizza.  Also, the Coke I ordered was delivered warm.  When I placed this order, I asked if the soda was cold and was told that it was.  Had I known it was not cold, I would not have order Coke with this pizza.\nI was disappointed with the food and will not order from Domino's again.",

The roll was passable-- for like something you might buy in a supermarket, if that! The seaweed salad was totally inedible though. As in, it just didn't taste right at all. My friend's sushi didn't look particularly appetizing and when I asked her how it was she just looked at me and said, \"Eh.\"",

    "I normally don't give reviews but I am very disappointed. I have used them before and were fairly okay with my cat. But I called them with an emergency with my rat. He was not breathing normal yesterday and they refused to see me. They had a doctor call me to described what happened. Which I don't know how that would help my rat. But he was definitely more worried about getting off his shift than helping save an animals life. Just because it's a rat doesn't mean it's not a life. Thankfully I did find a hospital that would take him... In California.. But I'd certainly drive the miles for someone who cares.",

    "They don't listen very well - requested an Iced Pumpkin Latte w/one pump of syrup, but they loaded it up on sugar, so I couldn't drink it at all. I finally was able to circle back later on in the night to get it remade correctly. Even if they gave the original Latte to me for free, I would've chucked it away, which is what they did at the counter. Also, I rarely ever ask for drinks or food to be remade.The employee that remade it wasn't friendly compared to his coworker. Service needs love for sure. Lastly, I'm not even that picky of a coffee connoisseur compared to others! Geeze, get it together, Dunkin!",
    "The wait time in here after the club was HORRENDOUS!!! I'm sure we waited an hour for 2 sandwiches! But my food was freshly prepared and either it was good as hell or I was drunk.

Not sure how this apartment is being managed because this is  unacceptable. On top of that I've called twice to ask for the mail box keys and have yet to receive them. This management is awful!

The Artichoke and Five Cheese are two that shouldn't be passed on if you have a chance to go.\n\nI've never been to the motherland before, but I can imagine that the pizza here is as authentic as it is in Naples.  Just take a look at the wood burning oven that was imported from there.  It's a thing of beauty!\n\nDon't forget that it's BYOB, so make sure to bring a bottle of wine with you.

She said that some thing had changed and asked if I would like to come back and have lunch on them (she would email me a coupon to use). At the time I thought, wow, even though my review was 6 months ago, it's wonderful that they have reached out to me now. I did reply to the message saying I would give it a shot and gave my email address but unfortunately it's been 6 weeks and haven't heard a peep.",

I have been seeing the therapist named Natasha and she is really great.\n\nThe waiting room is really open and comfortable, the rooms are quiet and warm. You really can't ask for more out of a massage therapy clinic, it feels more like home than a clinic.",

It IS:clean,well-maintained,and convenient geographically.It's NOT:a bargain or a place where mgt. communicates with members,e.g. if they make changes at the facility they just do it,no questions,no apologies-like it or leave,I guess.I respectfully requested a clarification on something and was ignored;when I posted same on Facebook it was taken down almost immediately.Memo to AFC:the movie was called '' The Social Network \"",

For my birthday, I decided to treat myself to a massage. When I began looking around at the non-Massage Envys in town, I was happy to find this reasonably priced, independently owned option. They were having a special, $45 for a massage or facial, and at that price I sprung for both! I haven't had a facial in, oh, say about 15 years and oh, my gosh! What have I been missing out on?! I was afraid they may be 'judgey' since I am one of those lucky enough to be blessed with both wrinkles and zits. Though, there was no need to worry. Alex was my esthetician and she was great! She was knowledgeable, nice, and made my skin feel wonderful.",

They scheduled me for a 11am - 2pm window and agreed to have their tech call me 30 minutes prior to coming out.  I did not receive a call by 2pm so I called them a little after 2pm to find out what was going on.  Their rep said the assigned tech was still working on a job and she gave me no reason for not contacting me in regards to this delay.  She did agree to call their tech for eta and call me back.  Neither the tech or their rep called me back.  Had I known they were going to blow me off I would have called another company to repair my air unit that day.  As a result I had to go another night without A/C and had another company complete the repair the following morning.",
    "I have been donating to this place for ages, and I occassionally shop there too. Never again. We came out in the pouring rain and I was turned away because strollers are not allowed in the store. Really? You'd rather have my cranky 18-month-old tear up the place? I wonder why - the wheels? Do they turn away people in wheelchairs too because I'm pretty sure that's illegal. I will be taking my business and donations elsewhere. Big Brothers, Big Sisters or Vietnam Veterans even picks up donations. I think they're doing okay anyway because they just completely renovated the place.",

I've been waiting two days now for someone to show up. Company couldn't provide a window for service because the company has no idea if and when a tech will be available.

But this time the ladies sitting next to me spotted cockroaches crawling in and out of the grill! Both instances, the staff was rude and suddenly did not speak English anymore when I tried to complain. I will never go back there again.",

You'll make an appointment when your parts supposedly come in (they will call you for this appointment to be made), only to find out they aren't there the day of your appointment (after you've dropped your car off and are reassured while doing so the part is in). Then your car won't even be fixed properly bc the lack of communication at this place is the WORST and you'll possibly have something else damaged while they \"fix\" your vehicle. You'll also have to call to see if your vehicle is ready bc they won't call you to let you know. Just take it somewhere else if you value your vehicle.",
    "I would avoid this place!  They are around the corner from my house, so how convenient.

I only need you because you have a lifting ring to attach to the motor so you can slide the bracket between the motor and the transom.  That's it...  And I explained that.  Still too much for her service department to handle.  Guess they are all that incompetent.\n\n\nRidiculous",

Not sure how this apartment is being managed because this is  unacceptable. On top of that I've called twice to ask for the mail box keys and have yet to receive them. This management is awful!

She was rather hyper about this and told me the card was declined. I knew it couldn't have been. I paid cash because we were on our way to my brothers wedding. After we left, I got a text notification that the charge had been approved. I called Monday morning and spoke to the manager. She was friendly but offered nothing for their mistake. My bank is holding the finds for 10 days because of this business and I didn't receive much of an apology or anything to compensate for their error.

    "They don't listen very well - requested an Iced Pumpkin Latte w/one pump of syrup, but they loaded it up on sugar, so I couldn't drink it at all. I finally was able to circle back later on in the night to get it remade correctly. Even if they gave the original Latte to me for free, I would've chucked it away, which is what they did at the counter. Also, I rarely ever ask for drinks or food to be remade.The employee that remade it wasn't friendly compared to his coworker. Service needs love for sure. Lastly, I'm not even that picky of a coffee connoisseur compared to others! Geeze, get it together, Dunkin!",

The doctor told us that they could euthanize him, and cremate him for us. \n\nHe took the bunny back and it wasn't explained to us how long it would take, when we would get the ashes, etc. So we waited in the lobby for an hour and a half until someone came up and asked if we could be helped. We told her we were waiting on the ashes. She went and checked and they said that it takes a couple of days. \n\nWe waited a week and a half and called them after not hearing word, and they said that they disposed of our animal's ashes without our consent and against our wishes.\n\nThen the vet tried to claim that we didn't request the ashes, which is ludicrous. The vet tried to put the blame on us, and refused to give us a refund for our hardship. I will never take our animals here again.",

    "I want to love Effie's, but I agree with some of the reviews here that the food, while OK, is overpriced.

Hey DD, \"time to make the coffee!\" \n\nIt was obvious the person behind the counter was new because when I ordered blueberry flavor they had to ask a manager if they had that. Plus, he was so confused he asked the manager if she could make it for me, she refused and said it was easy and just pointed to where things were.

    "I called the office before i went in and told them my purpose for wanting an appointment. Then when i got there they told me they wouldn't write me the prescription that i wanted. I have zero health issues and know that this prescription is written regularly so i was confused. Then they charged me $108. I didn't see a doctor or get a prescription. Very dissatisfying.",

    "I know people love it here for the sandwiches- they are delicious after all. But their pastries, pies and tarts are my favorite! This is my go to spot for a fruit tart. The vanilla one is the best! Next on the list is the carrot cake and their pecan pie during the holidays. If you're ever in a pinch and in need of dessert, Beyond Bread should be on your list!",
    "I have come here a few times and on 2 occasion now they have gotten my drink order wrong.\nBoth times they fixed it right away though.\n\nOne time they gave me regular when I asked for decaf and I could feel it right away - wow.  What a jolt!\n\nThe 'Bux in Paoli is way better.",
    "The worst ever. They have been ignoring our issues. First, it takes them weeks to address the issues and then you don't hear back from them, no solution, no followup about the issue they just disappear.It's been more than 2 months and nothing is done. I will never rent any of their properties.",
    "Received a flyer from them,  called and talked to secretary but never received a call back from them to schedule an appointment.",
    "Food is ok. Atmosphere... If you like edm that is way to loud then you'll love it, otherwise don't bother. Waitstaff who argues when they mess up your order, even after you ask them to fix it. If friends of staff are there when this occurs they also start in on you. Won't be back, which is sad because we used to come here often.\n\nEdit: the fact that they argue facts and belittle customers should tell you all alot. Also didn't complain about the music, stating a fact... It is very loud and edm. Obviously it didn't bother me that's why we came, but it might others so they should be aware",

    "Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT rent or buy a house that is located within this HOA. They are the WORST. They have threatened me and my family, they think they are above the law, they will do whatever it takes to bully you into submission.

You will be thankful you did.",

    "I hired All-American to come over and deal with an infestation. Salesman came out first, looked at problem and informed me what the company would do. Technician came out to handle the problem and informed me he doesn't climb ladders. The issue would require a step ladder.... not a 20 foot ladder... Seriously? A company that handles spiders, bees, etc.. can't climb ladders?? Obviously if the salesman had mentioned this, I wouldn't have wasted their time. But this is just another example of a company whose sales people aren't in touch with company practices.  Is no one accountable anymore?",
    "It's fine. It you're drinking and just need food to get you through the night. I wouldn't order doors from here intentionally or come here for a meal. Its literally bar food only. And not that great. Restaurant employees are rude and unhappy. They get the job done, that's about it.",
    "Food was OK but overpriced.  Service was not attentive and obviously irritated at our party of 6 for asking questions about the menu.  No entree veg options, no gluten-free, not so in-line with farm to table concept.  BYO is great, no complaints there.  It was also very very cold inside.  Not going back.",

    "I bought a groupon for this restaurant on the fly as I was leaving work.  When I came home I read the reviews stating that they charged $2 and an 18% gratuity for anyone using a groupon.  This is mentioned nowhere on groupon or their website (which seems to be consistently down).\n\nSo, I thought I would go ahead and call to find out if that was indeed true.  \"Hello, I just purchased a groupon for your restaurant, but I read a couple of reviews on yelp stating that you charge folks $2 and an 18% gratuity just for using a groupon?\"  \"It is for taxes,\" says the woman on the line, \"It is the same for everyone.\"  \"That wasn't my question,\" I said.  \"So it's true then?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I'll have to cancel that one, then.   Thanks.\"\n\nI promptly called groupon support and cancelled that groupon.  Don't let this place get away with that swindle.",

    "I bought a couch and made the mistake of paying in advance. These people will be very nice while you're shopping, but after you've paid or signed, they're done being helpful. They will waste your time and make you regret stepping through the door. \n\nThey:\nfailed to schedule a delivery;\nmade me insist upon canceling before they agreed to deliver on time;\nfailed to add the item to the driver's manifest even when it was finally scheduled;\ngave me the run-around to avoid having me cancel.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the sales associate, Farah, told me he would talk to his manager and call me back in 15 minutes. I knew he was lying, so I called Discover and had them dispute the charge. I'm glad I did, I am now three hours into that 15 minute window.\n\nI highly recommend going elsewhere.",
    "It's unfortunate that I should give them even one star... The sales representatives are quick to lie- when you catch them in a lie, there is no answer as to why they lied... Their service people are AWFUL! Try asking them for something simple, such as can you tell me when I can pick up my REGISTRATION, and see how nice they are.. I would never recommend this dealer to anyone! If you want to spend $20-$30k and have someone treat you like crap, this is the dealership  for you!",

    "Performance Bicycle sells bike stuff that is way overpriced, plus they are rude & ignore you if you go in the store.  I walked around for 25 minutes, not once did they ask me if I needed help.  I was going to buy a bike but they're more interested in chatting.\n\nScrew them.  I'll go local.",
    "Looking for something fun to do by the river walk? Try out the water bikes! It's definitely a workout, but worth it to see the views from the water side.\n\nWe booked and reserved our bikes online, i believe there is a discount if you do book online, but do not take my word for it. You have the option to have the bikes for 1 hour or 2. Honestly, 1 was good enough for me. Lol. There is no way you will tip over in the bike and there is a basket that will keep your belongings dry. The instructor will provide the instructions for you and areas you are allowed to go to. Very simple and easy. Just make sure you stay aware of boats, paddle boards, kayaks around you. Pretty sure you won't ever bump into them and boats are not allowed to go fast on the river as well. So you'll be safe. \n\nYou have the option to either bike alone or with a tandem. I'm glad i did the tandem with my husband, cause I'm pretty sure i would've given up if i was by myself. Haha.",

    "When I moved in just about everything was broken, Internet, all the sinks, the dishwasher, it's as if they never even stepped foot in here before I did. Place is old, very basic, definitely not worth what I'm paying for it. Then the icing on the cake was when I called to ask where the dumpster was because I just walked a mile looking for it. The person who answered the phone actually said and I quote \"NO! Go ask one of your neighbors.\" Is that the kind of customer service I'm paying $3000 a month for??? In reality this place would be lucky to get $600 a month on a year lease. Turns out that this place has something called a valet trash, I'm from California I've never even heard of that nor did I know it existed and they couldn't even be bothered enough to tell me that. I would pass if you have the option...definitely took all the warm and fuzzy's out of my move to Tampa.",

    "I was skeptical. Ordered two coffees a salad and a cheese plate. It was $38 plus tip. Coffee was good salad was just ok for $11 (I think) the guy at the counter said 20 mins for the cheese plate . So we wait. It comes out and wow!!!! 5 cheeses and a lot. It was big enough for 4. All the cheeses were perfect. The board was gorgeous. Nuts,fruit , mustard, honey. Stunning! Very worth it. The cheese guy rocked it. I let him choose. It's the way to go.",
    "I'm never shopping at this store ever again! I had a problem with an employee but when I went to report that person to the manager, she was very rude on the phone and acted like she could care less. I find most of the employees to be rude and unhelpful. I think I will go to a different Walmart where the Employees are much nicer! Walmart customer service is going down hill more and more!",

    "Not sure how you charge $700 a night and not even have the ability to get a cup of coffee or breakfast in the am.  The line for food / coffee was 50 people deep and took 40 min.  They had 1 person working.  Ridiculous for a  hotel at this price point.",
    "So I just want to be clear, this review is for the service department ONLY.  I brought my brand new SUV in to have some warranty work done. They ladies at the counter got me in right away. They were very friendly and helpful. I even got an email the day before reminding me of my appointment. \n\nIt was only going to take a couple hours, but they still gave me a loaner vehicle. They let me keep it over night, even though my car was ready. How awesome is that. \n\nTo top it off, my SUV came back clean!",

When I called them to let them know, they were not even interested enough to look up my order. Sheesh!",

    "The hotel is comfortable and clean.\n\nI was double billed for a stay there on a business trip. It has been a NIGHTMARE to get the hotel to correct the mistake. The GM, David, is the person who could make this happen. Every time I call he is either taking a day off or not answering his phone. David does not return phone calls either. Submitting my expenses to my company after this trip is very time consuming due to a lack of responsiveness from the hotel management.\n\nThis management of this hotel is poor and frustrating.",
    "I am so glad that I went here. It only took three trips to have my wedding dress shortened, to have the top taken in, to alter the straps, to have it bustled, etc. Not only was the work perfect but Dorca went out of her way for me. My dress was being altered during Irma, remember how we had absolutely no idea what was going to happen?? The shop was closed but Dorca opened to give me my dress to keep safe during the storm. Although the storm came and went, the gesture meant so much to me. Especially when people were fleeing the state! I would recommend this place to absolutely everyone. Customer service is A+.",

I told the staff the refund and cancel of membership,  and they just kicked the ball to each other. So still nothing has changed. Wish things can come around today later.",
    "Lmao this place is a joke, the combo plate that \"serves 4\" I could've eaten by myself, my friends agreed. Also the \"hotpot\" was literally soup with potatoes, they didn't give us meat or noodles. Dont go here, it is terrible.",
    "I got a 1/2 gram of GG#4 cartridge and 2 zero calorie quenchers and they both aren't working to their effects. So I go in and tell them about it, but they refuse to do anything about it. The lady said that she can't do anything based on preference, but this isn't preference, this is whether or not it is potent or not. Very disappointing, never coming again. OVERPRICED and DEFFECTIVE.",
    "I love Minds N Motion. The staff is very nice and friendly. Mrs. Connie (the school director) is very caring. We don't live close to the facility, but we are willing to drive for something better. My son has learnt so much since he enrolled here. He loves going to his daycare. Lots of activities to do everyday. I highly recommend this daycare.",

It has been well over a month and I still have no registration.  I keep calling the dealership and all I get is a run around.    The NJ DMV has no record of anything from these folks concerning my car.  So now I am stuck with a car I can't legally drive.",

He also pointed out another issue with my door and was able to come back and fix that issue quickly.  I wish all companies were this honest and easy to work with.  I would recommend this company to everyone!",
    "Have to agree that this place is weird. What was also weird was the way this parking lot is patrolled by both  security guard & proprietor who tap on your car window if you don't jump out of your car right away and go into one of the shops.",
    "Food was bland. The service was mediocre at best. For these prices, I expected more. When we complained to management and ownership, they didn't seem to care.",

    "Do not visit during Covid. I counted 8 improperly/unmasked people, including one employee. I was told that the staff can't ask people to wear masks- what? 200K people have died and you can't ask people shopping for dish towels to protect your employees? I asked a customer to put on his mask and he screamed at me. The staff said they couldn't interfere. \n\nI left after 15 minutes. Back to on line shopping. Silly of me to venture out.",
    "Honestly if I could give it Zero Stars I would. Customer service has ended up to be horrible. I'm stuck with a car I got from them that I'm not happy with at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone going forward.",
    "This place is now my go to place for street tacos! They even have my favorite, suadero! They also have the condiment bar for your tacos (jalapenos, radishes, lime, etc...). The bf and I tried almost all the tacos and they are just as comparable to the bay if not better. They also open pretty early and close super late on some days. Interior is very clean and with the tacos that you're eating you'd want to sit in and eat. I could describe each of the tacos I had, but, quite honestly I can't remember. All I can remember is that they were good. For about $2 a taco you can try it for yourself.",
    "Not impressed! Went in for a refill. Amy, the technician was extremely rough, cut me twice and kept pulling my hands. I asked for coffin shape and they looked square, I explained how I wanted them, so she filed a little more, but they still came out looking square and also much shorter than I wanted from all the filing. After less than 24 hours a nail started to come off. I went back and she fixed it again very roughly. She picked a color that was close to my shade but not exact and insisted it was the same. I will not be returning!",
    "We took in our lawn mower and received an estimate in five minutes. The price quoted was the best that we found in the area.  We are highly satisfied with the work.  Jason went over and above repairing the mower. We got it back in the time frame quoted, and it runs great. \nWe highly recommend his work and highly recommended that you use his services.",
    "This place is amazing like always food was fresh and delicious the ambiance is wonderful the wait time was a little slow today probably short on staff in the back today but this is a homage to food made in Germany the closest you can get with out using your passport !",
    "I truly cannot find anything positive to say about this place. Everything is EXTREMELY overpriced. The quality is sub-standard. If your order is messed up it will not be corrected, you will have to pay for whatever you happen to get. Everything is disgustingly dirty and I've seen no one clean anything. The owner is more concerned with his gambling ring than his customers experiences. He yells at his employees in front of God and everyone. The wait time for drinks or food is so long you might be able to run over to the mall while your order is prepared. \n\nI would never go there again or recommend that anyone else does. The health department seriously needs to investigate the place and put it out of its misery.",
    "I went to the dealership a month ago to look at a Camry.  I specifically told the sales manager I was just looking and not to run my credit. \n There was a credit inquiry from the credit bureau from this dealership.\n The sales staff  especially the management is dishonest untrustworthy and sneaky. I will never do business with them again.",
    "Probably won't be seeking this DD out in the future. Ok let's face it we don't expect much when we lgo to dunkin donuts, heck I don't even expect customer service these days (which this place fully lacks). What I do expect is a cup of coffee that doesn't make me sick.\n\nThe coffee was downright disgusting to the point where we threw it out. It tastes like it was made a day earlier.... Hey DD, \"time to make the coffee!\" \n\nIt was obvious the person behind the counter was new because when I ordered blueberry flavor they had to ask a manager if they had that. Plus, he was so confused he asked the manager if she could make it for me, she refused and said it was easy and just pointed to where things were. Way to go for customer satisfaction!!\n\nThis place really is the bottom of the barrel... Save your money, find a Wawa or a Starbucks.... Or a gas station, it would be better than here.",
    "Our AC was acting strange, it wasn't cooling properly. We had company coming, so it was really important to have it working. We called Western. My dad recommended them. It felt like Lloyd was more interested in selling the maintenance package than doing his job. He didn't really know what was wrong. So, he added some refrigerant and charged us $150. \n\nOne day later, AC is still not cooling properly. So, I think Western is terrible. All about sales, not about doing their job and fixing problem. Now, we have no AC and company staying with us, EXACTLY what we were trying to avoid.\n\nUpdate: Western reached out to me and said that they will try to fix the situation.",
    "So Disappointed in Colonial Hyundai of Downingtown\nPaid $66 in labor charges for 2 filters to be replaced - something that literally takes less than 5 min. to do (that's timing for both installed altogether). \nColonial needs to rethink their pricing and be more upfront about it before the service is provided.",

    "I approached the sweetbox cupcake truck today at the 2nd street fair in northern liberties. I heard it was good but had no idea how good it truly was. This truck has ruined cupcakes for me.

She hasn't seen the last of me, haha",
    "DO NOT USE THEM!!! Do yourself a favor, they cancelled my (82 yo) mom's move - 5 minutes after they were suppose to show up, on a Saturday afternoon when she had to move and move was arranged weeks in advance. Calling at 12:05 pm when they were suppose to be there at 12, that's why the one star they did call. Not sure how this company stays in business. My fault for not reading the reviews.",
    "Sushi & Poke is great! My husband and I just discovered this place. If you're reading this review wondering if you should order from here, you definitely should (especially if you want sushi or a poke bowl). Their customer service is wonderful and our food has always been delivered quickly and correctly! Every experience I had ordering from here has been on point !!",
    "Meh. I just don't get the following of InNOut. I haven't been impressed with my meals here. Tried it again and grabbed to-go from this location earlier this month. \n\n- Chocolate Milkshake - yes, please. That was the highlight of this experience. \n- The fries - went with the animal style and they were terrible. Too skinny and just taste like grease. \n- The burger patties are paper thin. I don't get it. It wasn't flavorful at all either. \n\nPlease, explain this phenomenon.",
    "Terrier was really helpful when I moved to St. Pete for work. Their property on 11th Ave was exactly what I needed, and whenever I had maintenance requests, they addressed them promptly. When I had to break my lease because of my job requirements, they were easy to work with and friendly. I am grateful for their cooperation.",
    "I stopped here because I always see specials on the board by the highway. The day I stopped in the special was one dollar drafts and 39 cent wings. I had the BBQ wings. You have to order 10 or more so I had ten. They were great!!!! The staff was very friendly and talkative. It only around the corner from where I live so I will stop back in for dinner or pizza and do a follow up rating!!! I like this place!!!!",
    "I called the office before i went in and told them my purpose for wanting an appointment. Then when i got there they told me they wouldn't write me the prescription that i wanted. I have zero health issues and know that this prescription is written regularly so i was confused. Then they charged me $108. I didn't see a doctor or get a prescription. Very dissatisfying.",
    "They don't deserve a star they some frauds and soon they going to in trouble . the apartment I was in had a mice infestation the way they covered over everything cheaply my electric bill was sky high pay 410 dollars for 2 bedroom apartment but it was a house before . they never do repairs",
    "Yes! The burgers are that good.  They serve coke in a glass bottle and you can get a milkshake.  Also, the hashbrown casserole is out of this world.  That is about all you need to know about the menu (except I think they serve a meat and 3 during weekdays?). Simple, basic, scrumptious.\n\nWe went after lunchtime last Saturday and it was still packed.  The counter can be confusing on how to put your name down (just butt in - that's what I had to do) and don't go outside to wait because you will miss your number being called. Or at least we did...\n\nBut aside from that, the burgers still are awesome!!",
    "Bartender was racist. \n\nWhen I walked out of the bathroom I heard him say \"this isn't racist because I dated a n*****.\" \n\nDon't go here.",
    "Always a pleasure to come here. First, the service is beyond outstanding!!! The Dubu soup is the best I've had on the East Coast. The atmosphere is perfect. I highly recommend taking the drive if you live locally or like me an hour away! You will never be disappointed!",
    "Came here after finding an abandoned cat! Their service is very quick when we got the cat checked for a chip. I highly recommend coming here for any animal matters, they are very helpful!",
    "We were here for a bar outing, we were wrongfully charged fo a drink, we were asking why the drink was charged on us, then the bartender got so mad that they started smashing glasses in front of us. We were surprised about it, but when we talked to the manager, she said you can't be rude to my staff. Then when we talked to the staff and they said honey we are here forever, we don't care. Do yourself a favor, don't come here",
    "This place is awful. Service is a wreck and smells like a pub that wasn't cleaned from a night and closed for 5 days and reopened. Stay out of this place.  It's a shame but there doesn't seem like a ton of options around here.  Family just walked in and I wanted to scream to turn around.",
    "Just got pizza to go from here   Got home and there is a corner out of our sausage pizza. Called them immediately.   The guy said it couldn't be because he watched the cut it.  I said it was gone and he denied it and ended the conversation.   Won't be returning here.  We did not eat the pizza as we are unsure what happened to it",
    "I'll join the 5 star group on this one! Although, I can only speak to their spa services, as I am not a member and have not worked out there. For my birthday, I decided to treat myself to a massage. When I began looking around at the non-Massage Envys in town, I was happy to find this reasonably priced, independently owned option. They were having a special, $45 for a massage or facial, and at that price I sprung for both! I haven't had a facial in, oh, say about 15 years and oh, my gosh! What have I been missing out on?! I was afraid they may be 'judgey' since I am one of those lucky enough to be blessed with both wrinkles and zits. Though, there was no need to worry. Alex was my esthetician and she was great! She was knowledgeable, nice, and made my skin feel wonderful.",
    "We spend a lot of time here. You know, being caterers and all. I love the selection, the prices and more often than not, the service. We're usually here for bulk items and they have yet to disappoint. The staff at this location are always helpful and very polite. They keep me coming back.",
    "This company is a rip off  I called for my air conditioner to have it diagnosed  charge me $79.00 July 2018 the supposed tech Ben B came 15 late and was very unfriendly and complained that he has to work at night he told me that the part will cost me $800.00 and it's a hardstart and run capacitor , ladies and gents they are available in Grainger cost $11.00  spp6 booter and $33.20 (2mef2) capacitor takes about  15 to fix if you are a rookie , so don't call this company they will rip you off",

    "Wow.    \nWhere was the manager on 1/19/14 at 3:00- 4:00 for the Masquerade bar?   Terrible.   I saw ~ 15 customers walk away.  You had one bartender working during the AFC game?!?    Seriously?!?   Re-align your staff to meet customer needs!   I am amazed how incompetent Harrahs staffs places.   Manning's was the same two months ago!    \nManagement needs training on how to re-align business needs quickly.  Glad I own shares in LVS and not Harrahs.   Management 101.",
    "Oh hell yeah, KAJUN'S!!!\n\nNow THIS is a place where you can get wasted and not worry about embarrassing yourself.\n\nThis place gets five stars even though I once got pepper sprayed in the face by the bartender when she was trying to get a crustpunk who was sitting next to me to gtfo.",
    "Go and ask for Hannah.  \nShe is attention to details plus!  \nFYI:  Make sure you bring cash for your tips.  Hannah is always booked and you can't put the tip on the Credit Card.",
    "I visited the drive thru. The employee didn't greet me, say thank you, or give me my receipt.  If you're going to be the face of the business then at least try to put an effort to be friendly. I hope the service inside is better....",
    "I had the pleasure of being a part of a party that was driven around for a wine tour by Tony Talia. This is what customer service is all about. thanks Tony!",
    "Love it! This place is great--everything from the vibe to staff and especially food is well thought out and wonderful. So glad to have a poke spot in St Pete. Although, they have a lot of options even if you don't like fish. The OG bowl and rainbow are amazing, too it off with a Dole whip you don't regret it!",
    "Came to this location with my friend to buy some apple bites. When we walked in it was very clean and organized, smelled great. We waited around with no one to serve us until we poked through the door to the back where two employees were talking. We had to grab their attention. The packaging we received was not appropriate for the order. I did not feel comfortable at this location.",
    "I have been going to Steelz since they opened and I love this place! The owners are very nice and are always willing to help. If your looking for Costco products without the membership this is the place. Go check them out!!",
    "Its very difficult to review a business like a law firm because everyone's situation is going to be very different. What I can review on that is consistent across the board is this company's customer service.  From start to finish you know exactly what is going on, you are informed every step of the way. Any questions that I had even if they would stray from the issue, there was always someone that could answer and help and go out of their way to get help . The kindness from everyone I have worked with exceeded all expectations. I will continue to recommend them to family and friends, even if they cannot personally take on a case for you they will find someone who can.",
    "Fantastic!  I love and support REAL Butchers whenever possible as they are a dying breed and we NEED them.  Steaks?  (T-Bones for 9.99 per lb, Ribeyes for 13.99 perlb) Chicken?  Lamb?  Veal?  Sausages?  Even Dog Food (scraps??)!\n\nLove this place and can't wait to become more of a regular.",
    "This place needs to be synonymous with the word \"Disgusting\". I have gone here twice, not by choice either time, but as a tag along with some friends and I have no idea how they stomach it let alone enjoy it. \n\nLet me just key you in on a lil something here, everything is pre-made. Nothing is made fresh. It's like they buy all the stuff and just take it out of the package, heat it up, and serve it. Its so gross. I'd rather not eat anything than eat here. And it's not just that a few things are gross here - EVERYTHING is gross here. The salad, the chicken products, the seafood, the beef, the sushi, the desserts, the soups, EVEN THE ICE CREAM is repulsive. \n\nIt's hard to say anything could be worse than McDonalds..but this...is worse than Mcdonalds.",
    "Trying to get some fabric cut by Nikki at Joanns... I was first in line she decided to wait on the lady behind me in line then bit my head off when I asked why. I hate the service at Joanns I wish wish wish there was an alternative in mt juliet or lebanon.",
    "Rip off\n\nUsed to be a regular when I moved a couple block away but now I avoid this place like plague. First there's a $20 minimum on cards. Bizarre but ok. My friends and all all had cards so we opted to put it on  mine and everyone could venmo me. I go and pay the tab and she runs my card before handing me the bill. The tab she ran my card for was not mine and was for well over $80. Our combined bill was maybe $30. I asked for a manager and she said that there wasn't one there that night and handed me a bunch of cash from the tip jar. She was rude, unhelpful, and definitely is up to something shady with people's tabs. \n\nThis place is poorly run and will rip you off.",
    "If it had an option for no star, I would. Me and my friend waited for 10 minutes to be seated. No one was helping us, the waitresses kept walking past us. I finally had to ask someone to be helped. When we both were finally seated, we were not being served in for a while so we got up and left. Their breakfast menu sucked! Not appealing.",
    "Sat night dinner for three, arrived at 7pm. I was told by Alexander the wait would only be 10-15 min.\nThe wait is only outside in the summer heat.\n45 min later, we were seated even though I kept tell him that tables were open. He mentions some nonsense about a supposed system the have. Useless.\nWe all had salads, mine was an uninspiring\nCesar with two crab cakes.\nOur waiter was too busy to offer a dinner roll until we were almost done.\nNot very happy with the\nMeal, the service and the wait in the heat!\nI, will not go back.",
    "What's below a 1 Star? Why won't the Nurse answer my call or return my messages? I just want my questions answered in regard to a procedure the DR. Wants to perform. They are very adamant to not allow any communication with the Dr. or Nurse. I've never been treated like this. This is my body/health we are speaking of. What happened to \"Healthcare\". GO ELSEWHERE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!",
    "We visited New Orleans Food and Spirits, and found it to be nothing short of amazing!\n\nTip: The venue is super busy, but the two of us were seated in under ten minutes.  \n\nWe shared the bread pudding and the catfish - both selection were exceptional.  In fact, I enjoyed the bread pudding so much that I had them box up the leftovers and I took them home :-)\n\nWhether you live here locally, or are just a visitor, I highly recommend that you make a point of stopping in here for a meal - it's THAT good!",
    "If i could give them ZERO stars, i would.  My apartment complex forces this service upon us.  We are supposed to have trash collected every day of the week except for Tuesdays and Wednesdays.....yet even on the days they say they are going to collect, they RARELY do.   WE HATE, HATE HATE this service.   I would rather just bring it to the dumpster...but now we don't even have that option since they are taking them away to  rely on Valet waste.   I WISH they would get rid of this service.  I would not recommend it to anyone.",
    "Just had the lunch buffet, it was delicious and fresh. Highly recommended and can't wait to order from here for dinner very soon.\n\nFavorites were the Special Daal, Corn Saag, Navratna Korma, Chicken Curry and Chicken TK Masala.",

    "STAY AWAY!!! Don't bother scheduling a pick up because they don't show up and when you call, nobody can tell you why... I had to pay someone to help me set stuff out for pick up and they never showed up. I called to inquire only to be told that the supervisor is the only one who can answer my question and I will get a call back from a supervisor later... Never got a call. Find somebody else to donate to, this place is a waste of time for donations and pick ups...",
    "I wish I could give less than one star.  They cancelled my appointment twice on me.  The one time I had an appointment after waiting in reception for thirty minutes I finally got to see the doctor and she lost her prescription pad...really?!!  She blamed her office manager for \"reorganizing\" .  She asked if I could come back in a week for the diet pills.   WTF?!!",
    "Been going here since they opened. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. The ramen is out of this world. Just be aware that parking is super Limited and you should get there a little early before they open so you can be seated right away.",
    "This place seriously sucks. All the nurses are rude and stupid. They can't read my healthcare plan and realize I don't need a referral.",
    "Came from New Jersey for the New Year's Eve party here. Management/Ownership is awful, after the party they screwed the promoter over on $1200 and almost did not pay my fianc\u00e9 who they flew in to DJ. The promoter has a contract for the New Years Eve party, I hope they are ready to face him in court because they are now ignoring him! This venue sucks!! Stay away!!",
    "Probably won't be seeking this DD out in the future. Ok let's face it we don't expect much when we lgo to dunkin donuts, heck I don't even expect customer service these days (which this place fully lacks). What I do expect is a cup of coffee that doesn't make me sick.\n\nThe coffee was downright disgusting to the point where we threw it out. It tastes like it was made a day earlier.... Hey DD, \"time to make the coffee!\" \n\nIt was obvious the person behind the counter was new because when I ordered blueberry flavor they had to ask a manager if they had that. Plus, he was so confused he asked the manager if she could make it for me, she refused and said it was easy and just pointed to where things were. Way to go for customer satisfaction!!\n\nThis place really is the bottom of the barrel... Save your money, find a Wawa or a Starbucks.... Or a gas station, it would be better than here.",

I told them I can make decisions about installing windows. Before the appointment was final they pulled up the dam tax records and had the nerve to say \" your wife is on the deed , will she be home ? \" Again I told them I am capable of buying windows and that I was getting insulted.  Today , the day before the appointment they called to change the date and time and sales person.  I think I can see how this is going to go .  I am going someplace, anyplace , but here",

Next if they cut a bartender and you have a tab with that bartender they make you close the tab and charge you $25 to close it!! I heard these people were out of vegas. Clearly these guys think they are still there. They really need to learn how to run a club!",

I told them that I have a Groupon deal but they told me that they no longer accept Groupon;their \"account was hacked,\" they said. \n\nOk, well I was already there so I decided to try their beef steak, collard greens and Mac and cheese. The beef steak/beef stew was good but lots of fat and gristles. The collard greens were over cooked and highly vinegar'ed and the the Mac and cheese was overly salty. \n\nI pad $17 for my meal and I ate just the beef chucks and tossed out the rest. Very disappointed!",

I would never recommend eating here. The cocktail was decent but not for the price paid. The fact that none of the bartenders or servers even acknowledged that we were unhappy with our food and just ran our card when we obviously hadn't eaten even half of our dips, I would never visit this establishment again.",

I only need you because you have a lifting ring to attach to the motor so you can slide the bracket between the motor and the transom.  That's it...  And I explained that.  Still too much for her service department to handle.  Guess they are all that incompetent.\n\n\nRidiculous",

    "Not fond of this place at all.  My friends and I thought we were going to a place were we could have a drink and enjoy some music. That was not the case. The music was so loud we could not even talk. We tried the food and it was absolutely terrible. Nothing but fried. The drinks were even worse.  The drink specials were either too sweet or not strong enough.  So beer was all we could drink.  I don't won't to forget to mention the service was bad too.\n\nWe will not go back.  It was definitely not worth the money we spent.",
    "This restaurant is nasty & bug infested.  The man, Raymond, who runs the place is extremely rude.  It doesn't deserve a star, but you have to give at least one.",
    "This place styles itself as a Dead/Hippie bar...it as far from that as these Florida Redneck Trump Thumping. Bastards could be.\n..I seriously doubt anyone involved has ever loved our band...let alone seen them. Place Sucks and their trying to make money off us...don't contribute to these profiteers!",
    "Not good at all. I have given this place 3 chances and every time they have disappointed me. Los Gallos across the street is way better and you pay a fraction of the cost. I understand that they just opened but seriously get it together. The food tastes like over seasoned Taco Bell. The beans and rice are disgusting! I do not recommend this Cantina at all.",
    "Went here opening week. What a disaster. It took our server 6 minutes to come to our table to ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered our food when he finally came with our drinks. Another 43 minutes went by (I counted)  and we still hadn't received our food. We also didn't get any kind of table bread while we were starving and waiting. \nSo, we got up and left. We were never offered any kind of apology or anything.\nAlso, the prices are ridiculous!! Way overpriced. This is Pasco County, not Los Angeles. \nNever going back and never recommending to friends.",
    "They have almost everything you could want when it comes to crafting. I went on this trip for some tracing and transfer paper. I was happy to find that they had both and a coupon that I could use for my purchase. \n\nI asked an associate where things where and both times I talked with them they were friendly and kind.  \n\nEven found a kindness rock! (OK, I found it back in October, but they do show up here frequently, I'm told.)",
    "Things have changed here. Used to be really nice but now it's not as nice and it's hard to get in. I got a groupon for a facial here and it was so weird & awful  - do not recommend for anything other than nails!!!",

    "I have to give this business one star because I can't give them zero. I bought a Groupon and tried to book a tour. I called 4 times in in week and always got an answering machine that claimed they would call me right back, no one ever called me back. I feel this is very unprofessional and that my business is not valued. I requested a refund from Groupon and went with another company that actually answered their phone and immediately booked my tour.",
    "I come here whenever I want a bowl of pho and they don't disappoint. Sizes are decent, service and friendly and they don't take forever.\n\nThe bean sprouts and basil tend to always be fresh and I like the broth flavoring. Service is quick and friendly too (although I usually order via phone and pickup).",
    "Sandpiper Property Management is nothing short of amazing to work with and has made my renting experience enjoyable.

    "My boyfriend and I have been bringing our one and a half year old Goldendoodle here for his groomings since we got him at 11 weeks, and we would never, ever take him anywhere else! We could not love The Dog Groomery more! Christy and her helpers are so good with him, and they go above and beyond to fit us into their schedule. Sebastian gets beyond excited when he realizes where we are going, and he pulls so hard to get through those doors! We love y'all! They even made him look so dapper today with a tie :) I highly recommend The Dog Groomery to everyone.",

    "When I bought my car they told me it was priced low so that I would never be under on my car. I'm trying to upgrade and trade it in, only to find out I'm 3k under on the car. Wtf!?!? They seem real nice and friendly in their but don't believe a word they say. They're super shady and don't actually care",
    "I went to Bobs in Springfield PA.  The salesman Anthony Rizzo was clueless.   He was so slow and ended up making a mistake programming our order in the computer.  I received my bedroom furniture but the rest of the ordered was left out when they came.   They delivered on a Wednesday.  i requested that they return on Saturday to bring the rest of the order.  They would not.  There seemed to be an \"I dont care attitude\" for their mistake.  After charging over 200.00 for delivery you would think they would stand behind their promise.\nBobs Discount Furniture...you get what you pay for",
    "Sent mechanic that left the back of my boat completely dismantled.  Also, broke one of my latches and found hose clamps broke.  Michael, quoted me no more than $400 but yet, charged me a service plus $400 plus tax.  I will never use these guys again. Make sure to get everything in writing if you do choose as their word means nothing",

Things from How to get started with Coding to How to Make Music using GarageBand.  Check the stores website for a class descriptions and schedules.  Apple is located on the Second Floor of West County Mall.",
    "I would not recommend this place. The staff is incompetent and dishonest. The owner can't even reply to email. They stole the value of my gift card. Back to The Face and the Body I go!",
    "BED BUGS!!! Stained carpet. There was hair all over the floor when I checked on. When I reported the bites and blood in the bed, they quarentined the room and had Orken come. They did not even offer any type of concession. I travel a lot for work, and stay at all types of hotels. I would have rather stayed in a motel than the W on Poydras. It was really bad! I could go on and on, but will leave it there.",
    "Our AC was acting strange, it wasn't cooling properly. We had company coming, so it was really important to have it working. We called Western. My dad recommended them. It felt like Lloyd was more interested in selling the maintenance package than doing his job. He didn't really know what was wrong. So, he added some refrigerant and charged us $150. \n\nOne day later, AC is still not cooling properly. So, I think Western is terrible. All about sales, not about doing their job and fixing problem. Now, we have no AC and company staying with us, EXACTLY what we were trying to avoid.\n\nUpdate: Western reached out to me and said that they will try to fix the situation.",

    "We stopped in tonight for dinner. This place is adorable and delish. The barbeque pork is to die for. The salads and dressing are made fresh. Everything is locally sourced based on season and availability. The staff are warm and excited about the food they serve. It's affordable and easy. Gotta stop by!",
    "We stopped in here to enjoy a pizza but quickly got up and left. Reason was it was so hot inside I just don't see how you could enjoy eating here. You do get 15 percent off for checking in on yelp!!! I ordered a beer and within 2-3 minutes it was hot, it would help if they cranked the air down so you could enjoy the food!!!",
    "My daughter and I went in for mani/pedi.  Three days later we both have chipped and peeling nails.  For the prices they charge, this is unacceptable.\n\nAlso, be prepared to add an additional $30 to your pedi cost if you choose to use gel polish.",
    "I went here with a gift card. Luckily I did because I was not happy with my massage. I was suppose to get an hour and a half massage but ended up with maybe an hour...if that. There was a group of girls at the front that were talking about another coworker and being very unprofessional. I had Keila and she seemed like she didn't want to work. But if I cancelled I was afraid of being charged. I told her it was cold and asked if she can get the room warmer but she didn't. And to top that off the massage was awful. I was in pain for two weeks. I've had plenty of massages. But never one this bad. I will not return.",
    "Since I first came here in 2009, the food has gotten worse, the service has gotten worse, the wait has gotten worse. A lot of people like this place because it's unique for Tampa. But the truth is, it's not that great.",
    "I love this place. The facility is amazing. I love the pool. I love the area. Not far from city park and NOMA. There are lots of restaurants I like close by on esplanade: 1000 figs, cafe degas, Santa Fe cafe. I also really like being so close to the bayou and bike paths. Glad I pulled the trigger on this place.",
    "Drive through order was perfectly sufficient. There was no one in line so the wait was in order. There was nothing remarkable. The service was fine, friendly, fast.",
    "Came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I didn't see a way to make a reservation or check for wait times so I made sure to get there. I really didn't want to have to wait. Got there about 15 minutes after opening and was seated right away. There was people already there. I got the chicken and waffles and a mimosa. The chicken and waffles was good but not extraordinary. The staff here is very nice. Service was pretty fast. You can also get cocktails to go here.",
    "I love their ice cream!  One of my favorites is the chocolate.  It's creamy and dark and amassing on a waffle cone.  My husband says the butter pecan and the vanilla chocolate chip are the best.  Their cherry vanilla is also a bit of heaven.",
    "Spectrum Internet Service in the Sparks, NV area is terrible.   My internet drops out about 5 times per days, and is out around 20% of the time on the weekend.  I've had a field rep stop by my house 3 times now.  I think it actually gets worse each time they come over. \n  Look at another option if you want to be a cable-cutter and want to use streaming services (Hulu, Netflix) to watch television.",
    "This place is closed for Breakfast!!!!\nDo not go for Breakfast!!!!\nBy the way,  this is a breakfast spot. \nVery disappointing.",
    "Ate the food before remembering to take a picture...it was SO good. Best Italian you're going to find in East Tucson...maybe even all of Tucson. If you're on the fence...definitely worth giving them a try. You won't be disappointed.",
    "I went here this past Saturday.  First the parking is awful.  Second it was so warm in here and packed at 1pm.  No place to sit.  They were also filming for a TV show.  It was very chaotic!  I ordered the 4 cheese mac and cheese with bacon grilled cheese.  Not sure what I was expecting, but it was way to heavy and I got so nauseated for 6 hours after.  I will not be returning!",
    "I'm currently in the waiting room in which I arrived early, paid for my parking and they are running late. No one has acknowledged me or even apologized for their tardiness. I'm not sure if this is the norm but it's not acceptable.",
    "Their service department is not bad but had to buy a work vehicle and already had one selected but it still took more than an hour and a half for a sales person to help me. Would come back for service but certainly cannot recommend the sales experience here.",
    "I love this place. This place is a must.\n\nLove the salads, burgers everything on the menu.  You must try the truffle fries!!! \n\nThe prices are worth the food quality. Service is always fantastic. \n\nLove it.",
    "I am unhappy with the terms of the transaction.  About 3 weeks after my doctor ordered a test, Blackstone telephoned me and said the equipment would  be shipped to me in a few days.  It finally  arrived  about 4 weeks later.\nPapers enclosed with the device informed me that I would have 5 days to return it or I would be charged  $25/day  up to a maximum of $125 and after that I would be liable  for over $1000.  Note this is before I signed any contract.\nSo, they get to take their time with my health, but if I slow down theIr  business I must pay?!?!?!\nI highly recommend that you do not do business with this company.",

    "About a month ago, I received a message from the owner apologizing for the experience I had here. She said that some thing had changed and asked if I would like to come back and have lunch on them (she would email me a coupon to use). At the time I thought, wow, even though my review was 6 months ago, it's wonderful that they have reached out to me now. I did reply to the message saying I would give it a shot and gave my email address but unfortunately it's been 6 weeks and haven't heard a peep.",
    "Went here for an olaplex treatment. I think the girls name was Sarah, and she was unprofessional as hell. Didn't talk to me at all, wanted to blow dry and straighten my hair without even asking how I wanted it styled. The wash bowl is super uncomfortable, and they had the floor sweeper wash my hair. I wouldn't return.",
    "Going downhill fast. Place is dirty inside, spilled food on the walls, paint peeling. Close for a day and scrub the place floor to ceiling",
    "What a bunch of Jackwagons!\n\nWent in for lunch today. After ordering I handed the gal our Entertainment coupon. She said, \"OH, we don't take these anymore!  She seemed surprised when we opted to leave.  What is this bait and switch? They get you to come in the door and then assume you will be to embarrassed to leave.  Not me.    How about a sign on the door or window if you choose not to honor your coupon.",
    "This office staff is indifferent.  I not sure if their awake. Forgot to place my chart in que Hiding behind counter.\n\nThe doctor said my eyes were dry. he wouldn't write a script for it t. told me to go back to my eye doctor.\n\nGo elsewhere  don't clean wquipment",
    "Do not visit during Covid. I counted 8 improperly/unmasked people, including one employee. I was told that the staff can't ask people to wear masks- what? 200K people have died and you can't ask people shopping for dish towels to protect your employees? I asked a customer to put on his mask and he screamed at me. The staff said they couldn't interfere. \n\nI left after 15 minutes. Back to on line shopping. Silly of me to venture out.",
    "Just witnessed one of the staff there chase after a delivery man. The delivery guy refused to pickup a package because it didn't have a sku and it wasn't able to be tracked. The staff member from Univeristy Postal told him if he didn't take the package, he would throw it away and lie and say that the delivery guy disposed of the package. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.... SKETCHY BUSINESS PRACTICES.",
    "So I ordered salt and pepper shrimp and scallops through Yelp and was expecting to just run in and pick up; well bc they did not have scallops nothing was made. So I sat in the corner with my child and waited for my salt and pepper shrimp to be cooked. While the food was decent the restaurant appeared a bit unorganized, even in the area where you order, doubt I would return.",
    "This place is the absolute worst. They're not ethically ran; they try to pass cards without fully expecting them. If you buy or rent a car from them, please double check. They'll sell you a car with worn out brakes and basically try to pass it through the safety inspection. There's nothing safe about this place",
    "Do not use this company! They are a scam and a rip off. They will make any excuse not to cover a claim and then have the nerve to tell you they are cancelling your policy.",

The manager was supposed to call be back when she came in at 5pm. Never got the call but was told when I called back 3 hours later  she went home early. But they could see my message. 15 minutes later I get a call from the manager to say that she couldn't take my reservation. I guess they don't need the business!",
    "The bartender, Kaydi, is really hot  and talented. Hard to come by these days! She pretty much runs the show there. Would definitely recommend anyone to stop by and hang out for a couple drinks.",
    "You know those restaurants that are just \"there?\" They don't really have anything that makes you want to come back for more. They don't really have anything special. They don't really do anything differently. \n\nThat's Weber Grill. It's just...there. \n\nI was there for a staff appreciation lunch today and I do have to admit, the waitstaff are incredible. But that's all that stuck out to me. Maybe im being biased, but it's one of those restaurants where it just...exists. \n \nThat's all I have to say. Haha",

    "This place is AWESOME!! Price is great, location is great!! I toured it before I dropped my dogs off and James was great! Showed me everything! When I dropped off my dog, I walked her back to the kennel and I actually couldn't believe how quiet all the dogs were!! Of course a few barkers an loungers but over all the ambiance (if there is such a thing in a dog kennel) was nice and peaceful!! I highly recommend it!!",
    "The good: the pizza! The missing brick surely does pizza right. I visited with 6 girlfriends one Saturday night. I had the OG. It was delicious and made fresh to order. The garlic knots are good as well! \n\nThe portion size is very large. Share with a friend or save half for another day. \n\nThe have wine and beer available so grab a drink while you wait for your pizza. \n\nThe bad: they don't accept call in orders and are only open Thursday-Sunday. The pizza is made to order so it can take 20-30 minutes to be ready. It would be nice to order ahead to save time. Hopefully they will add that feature soon. \n\nI'll be back for sure.",
    "I am in love with their grilled cheese... It is the best that I've ever had hands down.\nI also like that they have the coffee/water and snack for you to much on while you wait for your table. \nThe place is always clean, especially the bathrooms!",
    "No recommendation from me. This is what happened to us: we got rear-ended by someone, that someone told his insurance that it wasn't his, but our fault (?!?!) and 21 Century Insurance did absolutely nothing for us, but accepted that statement and left us in the rain with all the damages.",
    "The hotel is comfortable and clean.\n\nI was double billed for a stay there on a business trip. It has been a NIGHTMARE to get the hotel to correct the mistake. The GM, David, is the person who could make this happen. Every time I call he is either taking a day off or not answering his phone. David does not return phone calls either. Submitting my expenses to my company after this trip is very time consuming due to a lack of responsiveness from the hotel management.\n\nThis management of this hotel is poor and frustrating.",
    "They will ticket you at a designated offleash dog park you've never been to before because you are new to Idahos leash laws.

(mostly when everyone has gone to work already anyways lols) \n\nTo all my \"dog at large\" people who were cited for no reason\n\n(Cuz it may have been a chihuahua off its leash)\n\n\nWe shouldn't have gotten cited here in boise.",
    "Came here at 12:00 pm from a friend recommendation. The inside looks like a Dennys and worn out but the food though........Super superb! The food is awesome and blew me away. I would recommend ordering the bread bottom, which is loaded with crawfish and shrimp. And the pancake is a MUST MUST.  The crawfish and andoulli sausage hash brown is good too. Our waitress was very nice too. Will be back here again!",
    "THESE PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS. I've serviced two of my rovers here and never again will I go back. They told me I needed parts that I had previously replaced and were brand new. When I pointed this out they said they just recommend replacing that part to everyone with that year and model and said it must have been a mistake. It would have been a few thousand dollar mistake on my part. Trust me, stay away. UPDATE,\nThe comment from the owner reads very similarly to the letter they wrote me trying to cover their ass. I choose to remain anonymous because these people are criminals and I don't want anymore contact with them. The incident happened in 2013",

Came back to a $35 \"citation\" on my car, even though the paid ticket was in my car.  Two phone calls later, even after explaining that their company charged my credit card and texted me a receipt, they stated that they would still be turning me over to collections.  They \"graciously\" offered to reduce the \"citation\" to $25 instead of $35....so I just explained to them that I would be providing my proof of payment to whoever they sent to collect \"what I owed\" even though I paid for my parking.  Shame on this company!",
    "I'm never shopping at this store ever again! I had a problem with an employee but when I went to report that person to the manager, she was very rude on the phone and acted like she could care less.

Or do I really need to do this maintenance?\" This recently happened, and Brake Max told me that I needed $1000 worth of repairs. I took it my car to Barry and told him what Brake Max had recommended. He inspected it and said my car looked beautiful, that it didn't need any of those repairs. No charge. \n\nFind a repairman you trust like Barry, and give him your business. Thanks, Barry!",

It was shredded so finely that it reminded me of confetti. \n\nI'm not saying the sandwich was bad I'm just saying I couldn't taste any meat.",

    "Horrific! Everyone works at a snail's pace. Car was worse at the end than the beginning and all the manager and owner want to do is smoke, play on their cell phones, and eat snowballs!! Go through a drive thru carwash and save your money!!",
    "$49 just to get a quote? Really?\n\nI was told that I couldn't even get an estimate by email, even though I had a report showing everything that needed to be done. \n\nFYI Management -- I don't even know if you are reasonably in my price range, so why should I throw away $49 if you're not?",
    "Assholes towed my car. Took down a tow way zone so i thought it was fine to park. See you in court assholes",
    "My husband and I were very disappointed.  The ribs were tough, couldn't pull the meat off the bone, had to cut it off, as for the BBQ sauce, we didn't care for it either.  On the outside of the meat, it was as though the flavor was painted on.  All you could taste was the painted on smoke flavor.  The whiskey baked beans were absolutely nothing to write home about.  However, we did like the fried okra and corn bread.\nThe two times we went by this place, there always people waiting for there order.  So, I guess there are those who do like them.",
    "I would not recommend this place. The staff is incompetent and dishonest. The owner can't even reply to email. They stole the value of my gift card. Back to The Face and the Body I go!",
    "Like this place better than suzies its not creepy and dark like them. Its very nice and clean and just very tastefully arranged.",
    "I could say lots of things about how they tried to lie and steal from me, or the attitude I received when I noticed it as I was walking to get my car, but I won't. \n\nI will say, double check what you're signing. Sometimes they don't ask the questions and just mark you down as a yes anyway. Also check your CC, especially if you prepaid thru a service like Expedia. \n\nAlso don't expect them to help in any way. The attitude I received and the words I was expressly told were that it was my problem to deal with. And dealing with them during the Christmas season as I was going home to put my father in the ground definitely made it my problem. But I made it theirs, too\n\nI will never use Hertz again.",

    "Never inform me with reopen or close, just suddently charged me 69 dolloars a month yesterday. I surf its website, it shows fitness 19 in santa barbara is still close due to covid 19, so I didnt go to gym as nobody inform me. It is robbery of money. I told the staff the refund and cancel of membership,  and they just kicked the ball to each other. So still nothing has changed. Wish things can come around today later.",
    "We just had to leave, because the staff seemed oblivious and unable to serve. The restaurant and bar were busy, which is great, but we were made to feel like it wasn't even worth staying because the kitchen was busy. This is a shame. I've enjoyed the restaurant in the past, but this is the type of experience that will turn a patron off, completely.",
    "Disappointed that while they have extended hours M-F, they have closed on Saturdays. Working people need a place like this open on Saturday. \n\nI was a walk up for a moving permit, cannot register my vehicle until mid November, and still not sure when I show up at 6:30 with less than 40 people present to get my vehicle needs met. \n\nSignage is poor but I think they are doing their best. They are overwhelmed just like the rest of us. \n\nGo online www.dmvnv.com for locations and times.",
    "Terrible.  We ordered two pizzas - one cheese only and one works no onions.  Delivery in a hour.  An hour and twenty minutes later we received two cheese pizzas.  \n\nWe called Flippers and when the issue was explained, we were told \"so?\"   Upon speaking with the manager, we were told we didn't order correctly so we were \"both in the wrong\". He offered to send a replacement- in about two hours.  \n\nNo thanks and never again.",
    "I was surprised to see that I gave this go to spot 3 stars over 3 years ago, as I eat here pretty regularly. \n\nI love their fried shrimp banh mi also their tofu banh mi which isn't on the menu but they'll totally make you one. Speaking of not on the menu, they've also made me a grilled shrimp banh mi when I just couldn't do fried.  I also like their bun and the curry (which states is a shrimp broth). The spring rolls are solid as well.\n\nI do a lot of takeout since this is near work. But if I dine in, I always prefer the patio. The parking lot can be a bit of a disaster around lunchtime but you can usually find parking on the street nearby, especially now that street construction is wrapping up.",
    "I bought a groupon for a spa mani + pedi and massage.  Well I've called twice, and every time its a month or so waiting list for the appointment.  Now, (over a month until the expiration of the groupon), they are offering the massage only past the expiration date (can't redeem the mani pedi at that time ... or ever).  That is horse crap.  Don't offer things you can't supply.  LAME.",
    "The food is very good. Portions are a little small. But Everytime I go there I feel as if the service gets worse and worse. Nothing wrong with the waitresses, just that it usually takes over 30 minutes for me to get my food. Even if the food is good, definitely not worth the wait...",
    "You get what you pay for. The lot was small and very muddy. We called for our pickup from the ship and waited 45-50 minutes for ride back to car.  There is no system in place for return to ship. There were 50 people waiting for ride and a van that had 10 seats in it. So although we were one of the first to call for ride, whoever got to the van\nfirst as it approached were the ones to get on. They should keep track of order in which people call for return as this process turned into a mob type run to van ahead of anyone else who may have been waiting 30 minutes already. I was ready to take taxi!\nStaff seemed courteous.",
    "This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes I walk away vowing to never return, then others it's like...we need to return soon. The food is usually well prepared, although the Prime Steak bites are overcooked and tough, especially difficult to get off of the skewer. We've even asked them to be rare and they come out well done. I've posted pictures of Oysters and Sushi. The both were good. Probably one of those days I wanted to return. So as I ranked it a three...hit or miss. I hope if you visit it's a hit.",
    "This place wasn't crowded at the beginning of the night, but was full by the end of the night. The band played long and hard and I really enjoyed the music here.

Wish I could write something better but they do not have a lot of the food that is on the menu.",

    "Boo!  Our vehicle was towed while parked on Decatur St.(near Cafe du Monde),in a spot that \"seemed\" to indicate it was lawful(per signage).  According to the shop owners on Decatur, it appears that what is lawful is subject to the city's discretion regardless of signage.  Why waste time towing people, and not  just give tickets?  We paid $30.00 in fines and $100.00 in TOWING fee.  A conspiracy!!!  I'd think NOLA would be more considerate to tourists especially in this economy.  \n\nThe most expensive Cafe Au Lait and Beignets i've ever had!!!",

Bubble tea and sandwiches, you can't go wrong with this combination.\n\nThere are a lot of options, so be sure to be hungry when you come in. \n\nToday it is fish patty sandwiches and banana bubble tea. I can't wait to see what I decide on for lunch tomorrow.",
    "Do not do business with these people.  They ignore repair requests.  They say they will call back but don't.  I have had issues with the refrigerator and drip irrigation system since I moved in over a month ago. No repairs unless covered by warranty, but they don't pay the home warranty company so they are refusing to come out.  \n\nI gave them one star only because I had to--would have preferred zero stars.  But that would be more than they deserve.",

The meat was pretty good , nice and tender and flavorful , the waitresses were attentive and checked on our table to clean any burnt spots and cooked our meats .

    "I want to love Effie's, but I agree with some of the reviews here that the food, while OK, is overpriced.  I had the Effie's chicken, and it was OK, but nothing memorable or spectacular for $17.  It came with rice.  Rice.  Nothing else.  Just chicken and rice. \n It is BYOB, which I like and appreciate. But they should bring down the prices a bit.  The server was really nice.  She was cheerful and helpful.  \nI like Effie's, but I don't love it.",

I'm not sure where to begin, but I've never witnessed an owner of a business behave so poorly toward paying customers.\n\nWhen two in our party questioned why their entrees were late (the rest of our group had received theirs ~10 or 15 minutes prior), the owner was rude, combative, and more interested in placing blame on his customers than trying to hear their concerns and offer a solution, or at the very least - an apology.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the service from the waitstaff up until that point. But our table's treatment by the owner ruined the experience and I won't be returning. I think he would do everyone a service by staying in the kitchen and leaving front-of-house tasks to someone who doesn't need anger management.",

However, we signed in, picked our colors, and were taken back to the chairs pretty quickly. \n\nThe salon was clean, bright, and relaxing- it was pretty quiet but they also had signs up saying no yelling. The pedicure itself was good although I felt like they were trying to push up to get an upgraded pedicure and do a manicure as well. \n\nThey also have a rewards card system, but I believe you have to pay cash for it to count. I liked this place, but it is a little out of the way for me so I don't think it will become my go-to pedicure spot.",

You can tell when someone is talking About you but what they should have been talking about was why they were still operating when the ac was not working right, the meals should have been discounted. The manager kept standing near the table and watching us until the bill paid, then poof he was gone no more to be seen that night. I will never come to this place again or recommend to colleagues",

It was so easy and hassle free. I love that you can just drop your car off and not have the stress of making an appointment. I will definitely be back.",
    "Dr. Hart is amazing. He really listens and empathetic to your concerns and questions. No question or concern is too silly to ask. \n\nStaff are nice and know you and your pet by name every time you walk in.\nHowever, they are pricey.",
    "Looking at these reviews, I won't bother this company for coverage of a home I own in Fla.  They haven't even addressed all these complaints.  Thank you to everyone for their honesty.",
    "Horribly dirty \nMade 9:15 appt.  Arrived at 9:10.  They told me it would be a 30 minute wait!! What the heck?  It was very dirty looking, no liners on the tubs and they were filthy. I chose to leave!",
    "Company sucks, can't fix an appliance if they tried. Terrible, don't ever use them. After they tried to fix my washer it leaked into my basement and flooded my laundry room. They will blame whirlpool for everything. Don't trust them at all. I wouldn't even get them one star however they wouldn't allow me to post without giving them a star.",
    "While there, the bartenders made fun of a woman and called her a whore. My friend called them out and because of it, we were kicked out. They were not happy we didn't laugh with them but we believe that wasn't okay to do.",
    "Oh bon chon chicken, why are you so good. Why why why. And why do you have to come in 20-piece servings. Why not four, or five, maybe even six, so I can exercise some portion control? I mean...of course I'll order 20 pieces, if that's all you have. It is not my fault I only came with one person and we now have to eat 10 wings a piece. Right?\n\nThe chicken here is perfect - spicy (if you like it that way), crispy, juicy and delicious. Love the radishes, too. Come hungry.",
    "One of the owners is Blanca  She is so nice and always smiling and willing to answer your questions about her restaurant if you have some.  I had gone here for an event last Saturday, and I was excited to see a lady make tortillas outside.\n\n  I decided to try them out again today, and I had ordered what I always order a beans rice and cheese burrito.  It was sooo good I was very happy with my choice.\n\nPlus they have a drive thru so you don't have to get out of your car and order if you want something to go.",
    "We just purchased a house that requires heating fuel--something my husband and I are completely unfamiliar with--but must quickly learn about in order to stay warm this winter. I called Sierra Fuel and spoke with Sarah who was beyond helpful (and patient!) in answering my questions and providing information. She got my fuel delivery scheduled quickly and also gave me some tips for what to do if we run out of fuel before our delivery arrives. Really looking forward to working with this company for the winter!",
    "I only gave this pool store a 1 star is because i couldn't give it a 0 star. Completely unprofessional. Don't ever expect to get a call back because they are always to busy or lazy. When you call and question why no one shows up you get the run around and change their stories. If your like me and call someone out on their BS they get defensive and try and make it like you did something wrong. Not even sure why i gave this company another chance after the fall season when i watched one of their closers scrap dogshit of their shoe into my pool and try to say they didn't do it.",
    "I just called this place requesting a service because our home warranty through Fidelity is taking forever to get back to us.  The receptionist proceeds to take our information and then declines service request after we tell her that we have a home warranty.  I let her know that we are willing to pay them directly and not file a home warranty, as our home warranty isn't responding very well.  She still declined our request...I'm thinking ok...interesting...anyway, we will just go somewhere else.",
    "After reading the reviews on yelp I decided not to go along with this company. When they contacted me after giving a quote and when I mentioned the yelp reviews, the agent Todd Smith, got angry and abusive. If this is how they plan to get my business I can only imagine what their service is going to be like.",
    "Again, I'm only giving a 1 star since I can't give a 0!\nAfter almost 5 months, they have the BALLS to call me to see if I still want to buy a car!\nWow, I guess they must be pretty hard up to get customers. Would not shop here EVER!!!!",

    "Just average. 30 minute wait. We sat at the bar. Both ordered eggs benedict style dishes. I got the pork. Sort of dry and bland in flavor. He got the salmon. Again, sort of meh.",
    "This place is terrific.  All food is fresh, homemade and prepared with care.  The chefs take pride in their work.  Highly recommended",
    "Used the VIP service to set up a test drive. After they confirmed my appointment and arrival I thought I was set. It was an hour drive to the lot. VIP check in a bit of a wait and you guessed it Car was Sold. Our salesman could care less. Not worth your time.",
    "While the pool LOOKS beautiful, it has just caused flooding issues (which have now affected my home). The pool doesn't property drain and water puddles .....its a lot of money to spend to have water drainage issues..the pool has been in place since late 2014.",
    "The positives of this place are: they can usually schedule you quickly, you can get in and out fairly fast, and they usually can fix what ails you.\nDownside: I don't think the NP's are competent. Def opt for an MD. If you need hand-holding and want to ask a million questions, this is not the place for you. They kind of rush you thru things. \nI used to work for a dermatologist who really took the time and would answer questions. She was very competent. That being said, she stopped taking insurance, so Belle Meade is where I go now for convenience. However, I do feel they sometimes dismiss concerns. I also had a misdiagnosis from the NP and went to another dermatologist and the problem was fixed.",
    "$2.50 PRE-TAX FOR TAP WATER ? !\n(See pic) If you got two tap waters here you would spend more than a $4.99, 2 sliders, chips and a soda meal at Subway.\n\nTHE CASHIER NEEDS TO GO\nThe female working on Monday, September 30th at 1:32 p.m.:\n- after 3-4 minutes flirting with some guys away from the register\n- \"Can I have your order?\"\n- I order\n- she turns away and starts joking with an employee, a bit later\n- \"Can I have your order?\"\n- Irritatedly I told her that I just gave it to her\n\nAFTER THAT IT GOT UGLY\nI asked for a refund because I wasn't paying $2.50 for NOLA tap water.

    "Staff was super inconsiderate and overbearing. Check out time is 11am.  Staff was texting at 9am with reminders that check out was 11am.  When I did not reply since I was in the shower, housekeeping suddenly starts knocking at the door and trying to get into the room. Naked and yelling to hold on wrapping a towel around me I open the door with nobody there only to have another housekeeper try getting into the room again saying that they thought I had left since I did not reply to their text message!

    "I went to this restaurant to watch the FIFA World Cup. It was busy, but not overly busy. \n\nThings started off good when I got there. The waitress put in my breakfast order and drink. When my friend showed up that's when the problems began as they became busier. \n\nHe doesn't understand Spanish so I helped him order for breakfast and then when we decided we wanted to get lunch she just disappeared for like 45 minutes after I asked for the lunch menu and didn't bring us the drinks we ordered or come to check on us at all. \n\nShe did visit the tables around us though and service them. \n\nWhen she finally came back to our table she pretended like we never told her we wanted drinks and pointed to the dinner menu instead of the lunch menu to order from...\n\nObviously we decided we didn't want to get lunch anymore and closed our check as soon as the game was over and left. \n\nThis is a sports bar and is supposed to be made for sports games...if you can't handle 20-30 people in a venue...maybe you need to prioritize.",

    "After having a reservation at a rooftop and getting so excited to be outside with a view, this is where we were seated - inside next to the bathroom with no view whatsoever. It was literally crappy hearing and smelling the bathroom behind me. The prices are not worth it, and my time was wasted for this \"rooftop\" experience.",
    "I love Everest. I have been here during their lunch buffet and for dinner. Their lentil soup is incredible! I want to say what is good about it before I go into the not so good. \n\nWhat loses the star is the service during dinner.  At first it was great. They explained the menu, the food came out quick, everything was good. Problems started when it hit 8:30. They started mopping, turned off the music and turned on a TV in the bar area--basically straight up closing while we are still eating. For a moment I thought they closed at 8:30. If that was the case, I would completely understand them closing around us, but they did not close until 9:00! Not cool.\n\n\nAgain, I really like Everest. I will go again both for the lunch buffet and dinner. BUT if something like that happens again, I do not think I will return.",
    "we've taken our 2 dogs to brookville road animal hospital for 6 years. the staff are very helpful and obviously love animals. the costs are reasonable and they give quality care. they are so helpful anytime we call with a question about our pet's health and never act like they don't have time for us. we often board our dogs there- the pups like staying at the clinic more than staying at doggie day care! we love that they always give the dogs a bath, so the pups return to us all clean and fluffy :)",
    "Signing up was easy, and Dave Ramsey recommends this service. Naturally, I hope I will never actually need their services, but if I do, it will be good to have a professional around to handle a identity theft crisis.",
    "Crap service. Bartender sucks. My wife and I stood in front of the bartender for 5 minutes and he never even acknowledged that we were standing there. There were 5 people in the bar. I took my wife to the car and went back to tell the bartender that it's rude to ignore a paying customer and he threatened to call the police. That's exactly what I expected him to say. If there was less than one star I would have chosen that option. I will never go back there and if you're smart you'll avoid this place at all costs.",
    "I am so glad that I went here. It only took three trips to have my wedding dress shortened, to have the top taken in, to alter the straps, to have it bustled, etc. Not only was the work perfect but Dorca went out of her way for me. My dress was being altered during Irma, remember how we had absolutely no idea what was going to happen?? The shop was closed but Dorca opened to give me my dress to keep safe during the storm. Although the storm came and went, the gesture meant so much to me. Especially when people were fleeing the state! I would recommend this place to absolutely everyone. Customer service is A+.",
    "I guess AMC Granite Run Mall Classic meant OLD AND DIRTY AS HELL!! It could be psychological but as soon as I sat down I immediately started to itch. I so hope it is all in my head because I can't take crabs or bed bugs home and explain I went to the movies 'alone'. I only came to this theater because I chase good Happy Hours. This AMC is closest to the bar/restaurant I just went to. I also have AMC A List so three movies per week for 19.99 is a deal if you are a movie go'er. But this theater may be a a deal I haven't bargained for!\n\nThis theater is so old it has cloth seats and ceiling fans. YES I SAID CEILING FANS!! Help this is like being in the twilight zone only less modern.",
    "This company totally sucks.  They tell you what you want to hear  so they can get you off the phone. How can I get a job where I can lie to people and still collect a paycheck? What is the purpose of writing a review that no one seems to care about? I guess when T1D isn't your disease, you, as an employee, don't have to care. Really sad.",
    "AMAZING but must eat right away when they are fresh. \n\nThey are all vegan & you would never know it. \nAs delicious as they are- they are packed with sugar & can be overly sweet (I cannot finish one by myself). \n\nThis is like a once or twice a year treat thing for me. \n\nService is great!",
    "This place was very speedy and were done when they said they'd be. They seem dependable and to know what they are doing. I would recommend them if you need car work done.",
    "Management is the issue with this location. Who are you hiring? Your employees seem either high or brain dead. Maybe both. The reason the line is so long ALL the time is not because it's chipotle and everyone wants it, it's because your cashier is as slow as a sloth!!! If you've ever seen the movie zootopia where the sloth is working at the dmv, that's precisely what I pictured with this one. She stood staring into space then walked away while I'm holding my card out in front of her to charge. Where she went... that's anyone's guess. She put my food in a bag so slow you would think she was holding explosives. \nPS your chips are always stale! \n\n\nUpdate - why do I keep giving this place a chance. The employees still all seem like they are high as shit. And the food quality somehow has gotten worse. How long have the beans been sitting out? I think they were starting to sprout! Yuk",

    "\"Raymond\" was a no-show, and I believe he's a fraud, ripping people off, and requiring credit card numbers up front.\n\nHere's what happened to me:\nI purchased a Groupon and called Raymond.  He answered, but told me I'd have to use his website to schedule an appointment.  The soonest available was 2 weeks out. His site required my credit card number, in case I did not show up, I'd be charged $25 no-show fee. I received a conformation email. \n\nThe day before my appointment, I received an email that my appointment was canceled. I rescheduled.  I arrived promptly, but the business door was locked. No one answered the phone.  I waited for 20 minutes. Raymond never showed up. Never answered his phone, or my email, or my texts. I'd like $25 for his no show!\n\nI suspect Raymond sells Groupons, but doesn't honor them.  It's a fraud and I've reported it to Groupon.  Anyone else with this experience ought to consider doing same.",
    "I think this is worth the drive out of the city. They have tons of lanes, an arcade with air hockey and a bar/restaurant that is attached if you want food for your lanes.\n\nIt's about $5 a game, and you probably won't have to wait too long. They also have babysitting and you can go anytime (it's 24 hours). The post 3 a.m. crowd gets kinda' weird though.",
    "Scheduling issues. Service tech came a day early. Took three times before we actually had the service call. They need to address their scheduling issues.  It must be part of the appt to upsale. The tech sure tried his best. Also the Tech should have removed his shoes tracked mud in our house.",

After looking at the menu for 2 or 3 minutes I decided on a chili dog combo.\nI pushed the call button and \"P*****p\" asked me for my order, I told him what I wanted, and IT WAS AT THAT TIME HE TOLD ME \"SORRY, OUR KITCHEN IS CLOSED!\"\nI asked \"What time do you close?\", P*****p said \"10 PM\", it was now about 9:40. I said \"You're a restaurant and you're NOT serving food?\"...\"so you're closed.\"\nP*****p said \"We're ONLY serving drinks now, all of the equipment is shut-off.\"\nI said \"Thanks a lot\"-\nI left and drove just a little further down the road to Hardees' and got one of their chili dog combos- and it was pretty good! \nAnd the employees at Hardees' were nice and friendly!\n\n******************UPDATE******************\nI sent the above to Sonic's corp. website approx. 3 weeks ago with no response.

    "The interior at Sushi Wave is cool, blue, and modern.  All ordering is done through a tablet, which was super easy to use.  The pictures and descriptions were helpful.  All of the rolls we tried were delicious.  My favorites were The Wave (snow crab mix, avocado,  and cucumber topped with cubed Tuna and Salmon drizzled with house specialty sauce), The Tuna Crunch (flash fried roll with tuna, cream cheese, and asparagus) and The Electric Eel (crab, cucumber, cream cheese, topped  with avocado and broiled eel with eel sauce and tempura flakes.)  \nLychee sake and Fried Cheesecake rounded out my meal.",
    "Very disappointed. \n\nI love Mel's... but when you can't even get them on the phone to place an order and wait over 30 minutes for them to hang up on you, and not pick back up...was beyond disappointing. \n\nI ended up getting Roberto's...\n\nAll I wanted was an open faced Turkey Sandwich.",

I call after a couple of weeks and am told we are looking foe parts and will keep looking.  I keep calling periodically and get the we are looking for transistors amswer.  After 16 months I go to pick it up and they dont refund the $40 and then when I take it to Alpha Tech and Pay them $50 they tell me it was not the transistors it is the board and it needs $500 worth of work.  Needless to say I am not happy.",

I've been here quite a few times with friends and have never had this happen, this time it was just me and the Hubz and this happened. VERY TACKY.  I guess the bartender assumed that we would not tip 20% on our own, so she decided to \"help us out\" with it.  We will not be returning to this establishment but will instead, spend our money elsewhere.",

We booked a room for our anniversary to spend the night in the French Quarter. \nI am writing this review because I sent an email to the Hotel Monteleone telling them that there was mold embedded in the shower caulking, water in the ice bucket and lightbulbs out in our room. \nI wrote to them again, when I received an email asking me how our stay was. This was 3 months ago and I still have not received a return email. \nI would love to give this hotel another try and I would love to refer my friends and family, but not without an apology.",
    "BED BUGS!!! Stained carpet. There was hair all over the floor when I checked on. When I reported the bites and blood in the bed, they quarentined the room and had Orken come.

They looked at the vehicle and said they would have to get the \"Hybrid Tech\".  I waited until Monday only to be questioned about the salvage title.  They said the computer would not work to tell them what was wrong and whatever it was would be exspensive.  \n\nI told them I would have the car picked up and brought back to Tuscaloosa where I knew my repair shop here would not try and rip me off.  My man who picked up the vehicle could get no assistance from anyone to help load it.  As soon as the started it and drove it across their parking lot he knew it was the transmission.  When he dropped it at the shop in Tuscaloosa they also knew instantly it was the transmission.  They did not need the computer to tell them the obvious.\n\nLet's hope their is someone in the Crescent City that is better than Lakeside.

    "This place is great my daughter liked it a lot. It is very lgbt friendly. It is owned and operated by lgbt so you get to know you are supporting the community. Liz was very accommodating to my daughter. Every step of the way she asked my daughter if they liked what was being done or if they understood what their hair was going to look like. She also made sure to show my daughter how to play with their hair and be happy. I was very pleased and would love to take my daughter there again.",

I was in a sort of a rush to get out of the dealership as my wife started to feel ill about halfway through the paperwork. Basically I was fed a line of crap and when I tried to use the warranty I couldn't because it was out of specs. Please don't get taken like I did, demand a list of rules or a booklet about the warranty if you get one. I feel like I was ripped off by this guy that knew I was trying to get out of there.

I was not allowed to take pictures which seemed weird. The consultant didn't really know ANYTHING, every question I asked she said she had to go ask her manager. Super disappointed in this place. They need to restock their dresses or dramatically drop their prices. There is zero chance I'd ever recommend this place.",

    "Not impressed! Went in for a refill. Amy, the technician was extremely rough, cut me twice and kept pulling my hands. I asked for coffin shape and they looked square, I explained how I wanted them, so she filed a little more, but they still came out looking square and also much shorter than I wanted from all the filing. After less than 24 hours a nail started to come off. I went back and she fixed it again very roughly. She picked a color that was close to my shade but not exact and insisted it was the same. I will not be returning!",
    "I really wanted to like this place. But it's just too.... I dunno. Where to start... first of all, the space is far too small for the music. The music is good, but it's pumped so loudly through the speakers that you can't really speak to the person standing inches from you nor really enjoy the music itself. The layout kinda sucks, if you don't have a table or booth, are sitting at the bar, or on the dancefloor you're screwed. You're literally left standing in a 6\"x6\" space, being bumped into CONSTANTLY, in a bar that's way overcrowded and stupid hot. I'm glad there wasn't a cover because I probably would've been shittier. If I wanted that experience I'd go to a college town, not downtown Indy. That said, I'll def not be returning.",
    "La Calaca loses a star in this review.  The guacamole is staggeringly delicious.  The entrees (baja fish tacos) were delicious.  The plantains (pronounced /plantn/, which no one on the staff seems to know) are awesome.  The service is attentive and warm.\n\nBut there are issues.  The desserts are lackluster and need to be rethought completely. They taste like nothing.  Flavorless.  The coffee and decaf are equally unimpressive.  Seriously, how difficult can that be?  The bathrooms could be cleaner, as well as the service area next to them, where garbage bin was overflowing.\n\nLet's learn how to pronounce the food on the menu.  Plan-tain is so, er, ah, Philly.",
    "So unhappy. So much was missed. They were in and out.  I feel they could have cared less. 1k price, I expect better.  My house is 2 years old. The dirt in the grout should be able to be cleaned, if cleaned properly.  One thousand dollars!  You look at the pictures and tell me if it's worth it.",
    "I'm confused as to what is going on here. I run a stolen bike page on Facebook. Lot of people reporting they found their bike here. One even with the U lock around the frame and wheel. Owner says he takes ID of those who sells him bikes. I hope so. Hate to think the worst. But for now they get one star from me. The fact is if your bike is stolen it somehow winds up here!",
    "I have used Mayfield for many of life's occasions. They made my wedding a dream and most recently- my\nMother's funeral. Greg went above and beyond with his care and patience. The flowers were even more beautiful than I could have hoped for. They lasted weeks and make me smile every time I see them. Thank you thank you!",
    "I recently had to get a lot of clothes altered.  And Debbie at Countryside Tailors is absolutely fabulous and always is able to help me to get the fit I want.  She is very friendly and I would recommend her for any alterations you may need.  They also do Dry Cleaning at this location.",
    "I was with the group of 10 last Friday (Nov. 30th) who were treated horribly by the owner. I'm not sure where to begin, but I've never witnessed an owner of a business behave so poorly toward paying customers.\n\nWhen two in our party questioned why their entrees were late (the rest of our group had received theirs ~10 or 15 minutes prior), the owner was rude, combative, and more interested in placing blame on his customers than trying to hear their concerns and offer a solution, or at the very least - an apology.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the service from the waitstaff up until that point. But our table's treatment by the owner ruined the experience and I won't be returning. I think he would do everyone a service by staying in the kitchen and leaving front-of-house tasks to someone who doesn't need anger management.",
    "I'm currently in the waiting room in which I arrived early, paid for my parking and they are running late. No one has acknowledged me or even apologized for their tardiness. I'm not sure if this is the norm but it's not acceptable.",
    "I have to give this business one star because I can't give them zero. I bought a Groupon and tried to book a tour. I called 4 times in in week and always got an answering machine that claimed they would call me right back, no one ever called me back. I feel this is very unprofessional and that my business is not valued. I requested a refund from Groupon and went with another company that actually answered their phone and immediately booked my tour.",
    "If you're down with popped collars and bottle service this place is for you. It's massive, impersonal and the waitresses and beer tub girls are scantily clad. The service at the bar is atrocious. \n\nThe K'naan concert got downgraded from the Event Centre to Empire and boy was it disappointing. \n\nIt's also at West Edmonton Mall, which is fine for the 20% of the city that lives on the West End but ridiculous for everyone else.",
    "I made the call for service before noon and the job was done by 5:30 that afternoon.  I was only expecting to get an estimate but Mark was happy to crawl under my house (twice) and do the job right then.  I'm more than happy with the customer service and will recommend AMH to everyone.",
    "My taste buds are wowed (if that's even a word). The food smelled amazing and was mouthwatering. I ordered the sun-dried chicken falalte. It was very fresh and hearty (It had pesto sauce that was rich and creamy yum). \n\nIsasa and Summer were very sweet and bubbly. Isasa answered all my questions with a smile and eager to explain each dish. Summer was very attentive and on top of serving all the customers in a very fast paced environment. \n\nI also love that they had a t.v. that displayed their dishes so you can see what the entree would look like. \n\nI will definitely be visiting this place again.",
    "I love Minds N Motion. The staff is very nice and friendly. Mrs. Connie (the school director) is very caring. We don't live close to the facility, but we are willing to drive for something better. My son has learnt so much since he enrolled here. He loves going to his daycare. Lots of activities to do everyday. I highly recommend this daycare.",
    "This review is for King. As I stood in line (there's always a line) I noticed how pleasant and efficient King was with each patron. He made it a point to end every conversation asking if they need stamps. He was so sweet and you can tell he was enjoying helping the people coming to him. It made the line go by faster. I always make sure I have at least 15 minutes before walking in knowing there will be a wait. I don't get aggravated in waiting.",
    "I know people love it here for the sandwiches- they are delicious after all. But their pastries, pies and tarts are my favorite! This is my go to spot for a fruit tart. The vanilla one is the best! Next on the list is the carrot cake and their pecan pie during the holidays. If you're ever in a pinch and in need of dessert, Beyond Bread should be on your list!",
    "I went here to find Pork Osso Bucco and I found so much more! I had previously only seen it in less than a handful of restaurants and when I friend told me I could personally find it here, for much cheaper, I ran. The market is beautiful! Walls of wine and cheese...a bakery and a deli. The staff was very helpful and I want to go back to dine in sometime!",
    "If I could give less than one star I would.  I have been waiting over a month for an appointment only to be called today saying the provider was taking the day off and I would need to move my appointment another month out! The receptionist who called me didn't even know her bosses name so that I could speak with her and was very unapologetic. Don't waste your time trying to be seen by this group.",
    "I considered this the best KBBQ in Philly right now. The food, the service, and the atmosphere are great! \n\nSet A is more than enough for 2 people. The quality of meat is good, and I love the side dishes they offered. \n\nThe waiter was super nice and accommodating. They regularly checked on you and helped you grill the meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is very modern but still cozy. The restaurant is very new so I love how I did not smell like bbq food on me. \n\nI will definitely come back here again.",
    "ALLIGATOR\n\nI was determined to try alligator meat. Towards the end of the trip, we came to Felix's where they serve alligator 2 ways, blackened and fried.\n\nMy friend and I chose blackened since they wouldn't let us do half-half. \n\nThe portion was quite small for $12. The meat itself was not bad, a cross between fish and chicken. But it was overloaded with spices that made it very salty and unappealing.",

    "Love that they have been around for ages, love the building! The eggplant parmigiana was huge, filling and very tangy. Bread and salad come with the meal--gotta love that. It feels like you are stepping back in time when you enter the place. And I love that.",
    "The girl here is insanely rude and makes it seem like an issue if you have any questions.  Most of the stuff you can find for less at the French Market.  It's basically just a bunch of junk and t shirts.",
    "Accidentally stumbled in here while looking for a place to have dinner before a show at the Capital Theater. This is privately owned and   operated by the Scientologist  and if you aren't a member you will be quickly escorted outside by security.",
    "I have taken my clothes there for laundry service 3 times.  In each case I pointed out stains on dress shirts and in each case they missed them and then pressed the stains into the shirts which ruined the shirts.  \n\nThe staff has no interest in hearing about it and tends to blame coworkers for the problems....clearly the owner is not engaged in the business and I have never seen an owner there.",
    "Avoid Cox--customer service is horrible.  After 42 minutes trying to get service restored, a supervisor, Rebecca (785605) hung up and did not call back.  It's Verizon for me",

    "Okay...this club is not deserving of a one star ratting...but I am getting very annoyed being accosted as I enter the store by someone asking \"if they can just ask me one question\".  Now mind you I have been asked this question at least 20 times.  I don't want to be rude, but when I say no, they keep on talking.  Enough is enough...leave people alone.",
    "Went here for an olaplex treatment. I think the girls name was Sarah, and she was unprofessional as hell. Didn't talk to me at all, wanted to blow dry and straighten my hair without even asking how I wanted it styled. The wash bowl is super uncomfortable, and they had the floor sweeper wash my hair. I wouldn't return.",
    "Pretty good. They came for a work function and they offered me substitutions which were awesome I didn't even ask for it. Their loaded fries were very good and tasty. I ate a little too much of it though. The Thai wrap with peanut sauce was very healthy and flavorful. I loved that they asked if I wanted chicken and avocado in it. The deep fried snickers was good also. I would definitely order from here again!",
    "Came for breakfast. It wasn't good. The server didn't know the menu at all. I decided on the corner beef hash and eggs. Worst ever. Just slices of corned beef on top of hash browns with a couple of eggs on top.\n\nThe server let my coffee go dry and  brought the check\nBut never offered to refill the coffee.\n\nI'm moving to the area and am looking for a good coffee  shop. I might come back and try the pastries and or lunch but won't be back for breakfast again.",
    "Food was good the service was also good but we weren't happy about our waitress not wearing a mask. Covid could be deadly for some of us so let's take care for each other by wearing a mask let's be kind to each other & leave politics outside.",

    "I bought an Uncommon James Candle online.  I decided on Nashville Citrus.  Upon arrival, the candle was beautiful and cold, smelled AMAZING.  After lighting the candle there is absolutely zero scent.  NOTHING.  Even standing next to it.  My husband even asked if it was unscented. Disappointing, I was really excited and wanted to love the brand, but for a candle to be that expensive, I need to to smell good while burning.",
    "If I am going to spend this amount of coin on plants, I may as well head to terrain in glens mills and get the customer service that is attached to the price tag.  I felt as if I did them a disservice by even popping in. Sorry guys, I thought you wanted to sell something.",

    "Do not go here! I did my taxes with Tamara for the 2014 and 2013 tax year and I thought everything went well, until this this year (2016) I received a letter from the state of PA stating I never paid my state taxes. I worked in New Jersey and lived in PA and Tamara stated that the refund I received from NJ could be credited to PA for paying for my state taxes in PA, but according to the state that is incorrect. Tamara did do an amendment for me however she claimed this wasn't her fault. Also since it had been two years I had accrued interest and requested that she pay the difference or at least refund me for what I paid to get my taxes done (less than 200$) and she refused stating it wasn't her fault that the state was \"being difficult\". Do not go here, very unprofessional!",
    "After reading the reviews on yelp I decided not to go along with this company. When they contacted me after giving a quote and when I mentioned the yelp reviews, the agent Todd Smith, got angry and abusive.

When you go to a health clinic, people in the lobby will probably be sick. That's normal. It's okay. This clinic is really good, and worth the money they charge.  I'm grateful they took me, even after I lost my insurance.",

    "Just OK, I don't particularly do buffet's but sometimes you've gotta take one for the team.\n\nI usually have the Hibachi chef conjure up something for me.  That way I can have control over what's in my dish.  It's pretty good.\n\nThen I pick at the sushi a bit.  Experiment with the sauteed veggies, rolls and desserts.  This part is so overwhelming; I get 1 or 2 of about 5-6 items that I don't even want but it's a buffet so hellwithit!\n\nInexpensive and filling. Enjoy",
    "$22 for a day pass is CRAZY when you charge less than half that a month. They wouldn't even let me use any of the benefits - just gym access. Bogus!!! \nNever will I ever go to another planet fitness. Get some squat racks and stop handing out candy.",
    "Went to the dealership to look at jeep wranglers. On I got the dealership they had no wranglers on the lot. The sales associate took my inside so I could run numbers and for him to locate a jeep. They took $400 for a hold on a jeep they couldn't find. This was after the sales associate promised he couldn't get one. After this was all said and done he didn't give me his business card or a book on the jeep. He seemed lost and confused. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP THEY WILL DO SAY ANYTHING AND IN THE END THEY JUST WASTE YOUR TIME.",
    "On Sunday Feb. 25 I had woke up for work, went to start my car and it was no where to be found. We have been moved in for three months and have not yet received our mail box's keys or our parking passes. So missing work for two people and $175 down is not exactly ideal. Not sure how this apartment is being managed because this is  unacceptable. On top of that I've called twice to ask for the mail box keys and have yet to receive them. This management is awful! I DO NOT recommend this dump. The manager is very unprofessional! I wouldn't even give them 1 star.",
    "The food was garbage. I would not recommend eating here. The manager wouldn't find the time to talk to me as well. I don't complain much about food, but this was bad. I got two meals and both were not appealing.Go there just for drinks. They can't mess that up.",
    "My coworkers and I decided to give Wild Garlic another shot at lunch since the pizza is yummy and it's close to the office.  Sadly, the service is still exceptionally slow.  We sat ourselves and we had to flag someone down to get our drink orders.  It took 45 minutes for our Garlic Knots appetizer to arrive and then she came back promptly with our 3 slices.  At this point we were starving so we inhaled it but were still late to the office coming back from lunch.  The food is great but with the service being slow, Wild Garlic probably won't make it into our lunch rotation.",

However, they wanted to charge us $865 dollars for a $30 part. Luckily my father was able to get a part on Sunday and come and fix the furnace. Needless, to say I refused their service and went a night without heat. I can't believe they can get away with that!!! It angers me because I am sure there are some people who would be forced to pay the price. NEVER CALL THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!",
    "Absolutely awful\nIt epitomizes what's wrong with this country.  \nPeople have zero urgency, zero people skills and zero incentive to change.  Do yourself a favor and alway handle your stuff online and just wait. \nInstead of selling the turnpike privatize PennDot because you suck at it.",

They were nice enough... \n\nI didn't go back for the pedi... I went somewhere else. When I left there were about 5 people still getting their nails done... So they really could have done the pedi but I wont hold it against them as I did come in right before closing... Tampa shuts down EARLY.... Not use to that.",

    "This updated review is only for the Animal Hospital and not the Adoption Center.\n\nMy Shih Tzu that I adopted ended up sick with kennel cough and a skin infection. I brought him to the animal hospital on a Saturday and am pleased. Humane Society covered everything since he got sick within a week of adopting which is greatly appreciated. His vet exam was quick and painless. Because I am so pleased with the service we received I will continue bringing him whenever we need vet services.",
    "I think the kids who go to CCP are missing out by going to the carts instead of here for their breakfast sandwich. It's $6, but it's delicious and definitely enough to split with a friend. \nI ordered a pastrami-egg sandwich (with stock sauce), and I appreciate that the pastrami wasn't scrambled into into the egg! \n\nThe guy who takes your order/cooks your food is a crack up.",

    "Wait them out and you will be rewarded. Let them give they re sales pitch. I signed right away and 1 of my references didn't and one of my colleagues at work also. Both received checks for $1000.00 dollars for signing after stringing them along. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I refuse to have my panels turned on due to this sales tactic. They can sit on my roof for 20 years, cost them more then any savings id receive as far as i'm concerned",

This place is way overpriced. \n\nThey don't even have tacos or a burrito on the menu... every entree is overpriced. \n\nYou're better off going to El Limon or Tierra Calienta - Tierra Caliente has $5 margaritas. \n\nCoyote Crossing... more like Coyote Cross this place off your list of restaurants to try.",
    "I informed them that I needed a crawlspace looked at. For some reason they sent Herb, who was elderly. Not surprisingly he didn't feel comfortable crawling in there. He said he would call his son to come out. 10 minutes later he called and left a voicemail saying they weren't going to be able to help me. I lost a couple hours of work for naught. They need to plan better and recognize that some crawl spaces require crawling.",
    "The pharmacy staff here really impressed me recently by going far and beyond what I would expect from a chain.\n\nWhen a prescription of mine was no longer being manufactured and they ran out in the facility, they tracked down an existing dosage at another location, and put it on hold for me. All before everything was 100% in check for me to be able to pick it up.\n\nThanks CVS!",
    "St George sucks, we have a termite and spider infestation and they would not respond to our emails for weeks until someone's mom called. Termites are literally falling down from the ceiling onto the furniture and theres hundreds of spider egg things in the ceilings that are about to pop. Also we were notified that if they have to tent our house to get rid of the bugs they're not going to pay for hotel rooms or any compensation for the two days we need to move out of our house because they suck and didnt take care of these problems before we moved in. Avoid this leasing company at all costs unless u wanna wake up w termites and spiders in ur bed",
    "I hired All-American to come over and deal with an infestation. Salesman came out first, looked at problem and informed me what the company would do. Technician came out to handle the problem and informed me he doesn't climb ladders. The issue would require a step ladder.... not a 20 foot ladder... Seriously? A company that handles spiders, bees, etc.. can't climb ladders?? Obviously if the salesman had mentioned this, I wouldn't have wasted their time. But this is just another example of a company whose sales people aren't in touch with company practices.  Is no one accountable anymore?",
    "Came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I didn't see a way to make a reservation or check for wait times so I made sure to get there. I really didn't want to have to wait. Got there about 15 minutes after opening and was seated right away. There was people already there. I got the chicken and waffles and a mimosa. The chicken and waffles was good but not extraordinary. The staff here is very nice. Service was pretty fast. You can also get cocktails to go here.",

    "%20 \"Gratuity\" has been added for my convenience? I don't think so.  See, Gratuity is optional. Hence the term \"Gratuity\" here is the definition, \"something given voluntarily or beyond obligation usually for some service\".  What this place is doing is the douche move, and in reality it is called a 'Service Fee'. Besides if it is automatically added, how can you be sure its going to the person who gave you service?",
    "If you value your pet's life, please do not take your pet to the Airport Animal Hospital. We took our dog in for an emergency check-up. The Vet said that everything was fine, but if we wanted, we could wait for a couple days to do a $500 EKG test. Our dog, who was young, passed away that night. I would never trust taking my pet to this place again!",
    "We walked in and noticed quite a renovation since the old Pizza Hut! We waited quite some time for our drinks and had to ask 2-3 times for limes for my drink. Then once we got dinner we waited about 10 mins for our tortillas to arrive (which were part of our meal). My husbands dinner which was supposed to have mushrooms didn't. Slightly disappointed, food lacking flavor and my bacon wrapped shrimp was freezer burned. Water was not refilled until we asked. Guadalajara Grill here we come!",

    "The groomer cut my dogs tongue to the point it had to be taken to another vet because the vet inside didn't have time for her. Wow. Now, she has to be sedated to have the cut part cut off since a tongue will not reconnect. NEVER TAKE YOUR ANIMAL TO PLYMOUTH MEETING GROOMERS. VERY VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED :(",
    "When I found out there was an El Gato Negro in Lakeview (not far from my house), only one word came to mind: Margaritas.\n\nSince finding out on Sunday, I have already been there twice.

    "So sad to say this place has gone downhill since Becky left. Carlos stabbed my dog in the head while cutting her. They stapled her head and she was terrified.

    "We dropped by for lunch on a random sunday. The place wasn't packed but still decently busy. I split a gyro and it was plenty. I liked the pita, thinner, crispier. The meat was well flavored and plentiful. \n\nThe flamed cheese seems to be the favorite, everyone around us got it. So of course I had to get one. It was yummy. Service was good and swift. I'd be back.",

You'll make an appointment when your parts supposedly come in (they will call you for this appointment to be made), only to find out they aren't there the day of your appointment (after you've dropped your car off and are reassured while doing so the part is in). Then your car won't even be fixed properly bc the lack of communication at this place is the WORST and you'll possibly have something else damaged while they \"fix\" your vehicle. You'll also have to call to see if your vehicle is ready bc they won't call you to let you know. Just take it somewhere else if you value your vehicle.",

However, even after getting a confirmation e-mail that I will be getting a refund (it's been a month since). I still have yet to get my money back and they are not returning phone calls. Shadey!!!! I wish there would've been a review like this before I ordered. DO NOT DO NOT order from this company.

I spend over $200 a week on meats and fish and that's $800 a month and it's supposably not good enough. I can't rate the food but if it's anything like the customer service it's probably not worth eating.  Plus they want you to buy for 6months in advance. It's probably because they know there product is shit and at least they sold you 6 months of crap right off the bat.",

Also, I rarely ever ask for drinks or food to be remade.The employee that remade it wasn't friendly compared to his coworker. Service needs love for sure.

( tried to say I didnt have money).Should have known the first day they showed up we were going to have an issue, claimed measurements were messed up.

    "I am unhappy with the terms of the transaction.  About 3 weeks after my doctor ordered a test, Blackstone telephoned me and said the equipment would  be shipped to me in a few days.  It finally  arrived  about 4 weeks later.\nPapers enclosed with the device informed me that I would have 5 days to return it or I would be charged  $25/day  up to a maximum of $125 and after that I would be liable  for over $1000.  Note this is before I signed any contract.\nSo, they get to take their time with my health, but if I slow down theIr  business I must pay?!?!?!\nI highly recommend that you do not do business with this company.",

The guy said, \"excuse me you can't touch those watches... we don't have a merchandiser here to help you\".  Um he was helping someone try on watches.  He couldn't have just asked me to wait a minute?  I guess this store doesn't want people to buy watches \u200d",
    "Service was slow and it was after the rush so there were literally two tables in the establishment. It took five minutes to get a cup of water. The excuse the gal gave us when she finally got to the table was they were really busy earlier so she didn't feel like working anymore.\nI wanted chicken fried chicken but for some reason they wanted to charge me for more than for the chicken fried steak. And I'm sorry, steak should always be more than chicken. I mean, come on- it's chicken.\n  And don't even get me started about the flies. Luckily, I personally, did not get picked on by the flies for some reason. But my two companions were constantly being attacked by these flies.

The guy that was with me took it upon himself to push the reset button.  Now it does not work at all.  He told me it was broken and he would get me a quote on how much it will cost me to fix it.  Hes the one who messed with it.  I have emailed, called etc.  And no response.  Seriously if you want repeat customers you should be treat you existing customers better.",

You'll make an appointment when your parts supposedly come in (they will call you for this appointment to be made), only to find out they aren't there the day of your appointment (after you've dropped your car off and are reassured while doing so the part is in). Then your car won't even be fixed properly bc the lack of communication at this place is the WORST and you'll possibly have something else damaged while they \"fix\" your vehicle. You'll also have to call to see if your vehicle is ready bc they won't call you to let you know. Just take it somewhere else if you value your vehicle.",

    "The food here was not bad - probably better than most of the Japanese restaurants in Edmonton. However, I've never been kicked out of a restaurant. My friend and I came here for lunch recently and after our meal were just talking and catching up when at around 1:30pm were told they are locking the doors and asked us to leave. We weren't there for that long, probably just under an hour.  Ive never been to a restaurant that has kicked me out before and it's not like we were lingerers, we had just paid when the waitress came back and told us to pack up.  Anyways, that just tainted the experience for me and I won't be going back.",

    "For years we passed by this place but never went in.  Finally got up the courage and sadly was disappointed!  Food is very expensive.  Waited forty minutes to be seated.  Our meals were ice cold yet over cooked! \n\nFood was sent back waited forty minutes more for replacement food.  Food was finally hot and not over cooked but nothing to rave about let alone wait more than 2 hrs for? \n\nVery over priced !   Will have to take a pass on going back !",
    "Wish I could comment on the food but they packed up and drove away an hour and half after the event started.\n\nI was told they were upset due to competition. Boo hoo. Very unprofessional. It's ok though, Westshore Pizza was here so I got to eat after all",

Anyway, we went in and saw all the poutine on the menu and decided to give this place a try. We weren't hungry at all so we ordered the poutine slider in a cup, which seemed small enough. It came out pretty good, which literarily a slider inside a cup. The cashier warned us about that, which I wasn't sure why. It tasted pretty good, just as it said on the menu. I definitely would like to go back and try the poutines.",

Ok let's face it we don't expect much when we lgo to dunkin donuts, heck I don't even expect customer service these days (which this place fully lacks). What I do expect is a cup of coffee that doesn't make me sick.\n\nThe coffee was downright disgusting to the point where we threw it out. It tastes like it was made a day earlier.... Hey DD, \"time to make the coffee!\" \n\nIt was obvious the person behind the counter was new because when I ordered blueberry flavor they had to ask a manager if they had that. Plus, he was so confused he asked the manager if she could make it for me, she refused and said it was easy and just pointed to where things were. Way to go for customer satisfaction!!\n\nThis place really is the bottom of the barrel... Save your money, find a Wawa or a Starbucks.... Or a gas station, it would be better than here.",

Mo was bartending and refused to serve us while she called Richard, the owner of the bar. She then came back and told us that service dogs are not allowed. We were told to come back tomorrow and talk to the owner. I am shocked. This is a first and it's absolutely disgusting. Tomorrow the ACLU will be contacted, however, be warned that if you have a service dog: YOU WILL NOT BE SERVED at Dannys. Such a disappointment.",

    "I visit this place frequently even without a vehicle and it being an hour away,  but I was quite disappointed when I discovered worms in my brussel sprouts.  I've never cooked the vegetable so imagine my disappointment when I was following a recipe that instructs you yo cut and peel.  Leaves had traces that something ate away partially at the outerlayers and I'm petrified to learn what's at the core.  I also am unable to get a refund because of my inability to drive out within 24 hours.  Im not pleased with having to waste money.

    "I absolutely love queso and theirs was inedible. It tasted like gas station nacho cheese. The guacamole looked like it came from a bag, and the fact they charge $7 for a 4oz bowl of salsa. I would never recommend eating here. The cocktail was decent but not for the price paid. The fact that none of the bartenders or servers even acknowledged that we were unhappy with our food and just ran our card when we obviously hadn't eaten even half of our dips, I would never visit this establishment again.",
    "I will start by saying that I have had Pho from all over the country.  Sorry but the Pho was not authentic tasting. Hardly any beef in it as well. Spring rolls were dissapointing too. We were really hoping it would be good so that we didn't have to drive downtown but it wasn't even close to being decent to try again. :-(",
    "Had lunch here with my son, We both ordered burgers and a shake. The shake was delicious. I have to say we overheard the delivery person say something about that is how his grandmother scrapes off the burnt on the bun when it is burnt. That would be my son's burger. When we finished I asked for a slice of carrot cake to go. The woman took the chef's knife that he cuts chicken and burgers with sliced the cake, and then wiped it off with the rag she cleans the tables and counter with. Enough said.",
    "Looking for something fun to do by the river walk? Try out the water bikes! It's definitely a workout, but worth it to see the views from the water side.\n\nWe booked and reserved our bikes online, i believe there is a discount if you do book online, but do not take my word for it. You have the option to have the bikes for 1 hour or 2. Honestly, 1 was good enough for me. Lol. There is no way you will tip over in the bike and there is a basket that will keep your belongings dry. The instructor will provide the instructions for you and areas you are allowed to go to. Very simple and easy. Just make sure you stay aware of boats, paddle boards, kayaks around you. Pretty sure you won't ever bump into them and boats are not allowed to go fast on the river as well. So you'll be safe. \n\nYou have the option to either bike alone or with a tandem. I'm glad i did the tandem with my husband, cause I'm pretty sure i would've given up if i was by myself. Haha.",

    "This would not be my pizza pick.  They leave the pies out all day, and one Sunday, as I was walking to Trader Joe's from TJ Maxx, I noticed that they had a pizza sitting OUTSIDE, open to the air, next to the cigarette ash tray.  Not exactly sanitary or appetizing, if you ask me.  Plus the guys were smoking right next to it too.  Yes, the prices are cheap but I wouldn't trust the food here.",

    "Bicentennial Park is a sculpture garden created and maintained by the Rotary Club. It is part located along the Truckee between West First and Ralston Streets, across the river from the White Water Course. It contains a number of statues ranging from representative (sort of) in the form of Rhino Man to abstract or symbolic. The park contains a grass area and there are a number of benches to sit on and admire the Truckee.\n\nUpdate: Hadn't noticed this, but as Kashmir M pointed out to me, most of the benches have been removed. Some of the art work has benches built into them, and some have places to sit on around them. There is also still a lot of grass in the park, so bring a blanket and a picnic and make a lunch outing.",

I was not allowed to take pictures which seemed weird. The consultant didn't really know ANYTHING, every question I asked she said she had to go ask her manager. Super disappointed in this place. They need to restock their dresses or dramatically drop their prices. There is zero chance I'd ever recommend this place.",

They hadn't even done a diagnostic on it. Two days later they told me that the vehicle didn't fall within the recall mileage frame. \n\nWhen I asked then why they didn't tell us this when we brought the car in I was told that the service rep (Giovanni) was new and he should have known better. \n\nI spoke with the service manager. He's a joke too. His name is Darrell. \n\nBe sure to get any agreement in writing before committing to service with this business.",

When she told us our total ($7.53), my friend and I both grabbed money out of our wallet to pay. I beat her to it and gave the barista 20$ informing her that I had 53 cents. She was very impatient about this and dropped my 20$ on the counter. Then she snatched my friend's 8$ out of her hand. Oh the nerve!!! Last I checked this isn't just rude, it's technically an \"assault\" but whatever. We won't be back.",

She has called almost every week since July to schedule an appointment now that she did her intake, and each time she calls they tell her that she has not been assigned a counselor and they transfer her to someone's voicemail. None of her messages have been returned. We finally went in person after months of this and got her an appointment with a doctor, but we are still waiting for her to be assigned a therapist. It shouldn't take 3 months to get an appointment. Every time we call they transfer us to someone's voicemail and we never get a call back. There is never any explanation as to why this is taking so long, and every time we ask to speak to the director, we are told that they are not in.",

Their rep said the assigned tech was still working on a job and she gave me no reason for not contacting me in regards to this delay.  She did agree to call their tech for eta and call me back.  Neither the tech or their rep called me back.  Had I known they were going to blow me off I would have called another company to repair my air unit that day.

It seems though something was surely lost along the way as my friend and I got two today. The grilled cheese was very bland and his Hot and my XHot were barely noticeable in terms of heat. I enjoy the pain/love that comes with eating Hot chicken and it just was NOT THERE! The chicken tenders also were barely that of my thumb in length or circumference. These things could have passed for chicken nuggets. I was about to just ask for my money back it was that bad.

They kind of rush you thru things. \nI used to work for a dermatologist who really took the time and would answer questions. She was very competent.

I also had a misdiagnosis from the NP and went to another dermatologist and the problem was fixed.",

The bf and I tried almost all the tacos and they are just as comparable to the bay if not better. They also open pretty early and close super late on some days. Interior is very clean and with the tacos that you're eating you'd want to sit in and eat. I could describe each of the tacos I had, but, quite honestly I can't remember. All I can remember is that they were good. For about $2 a taco you can try it for yourself.",

    "The positives of this place are: they can usually schedule you quickly, you can get in and out fairly fast, and they usually can fix what ails you.\nDownside: I don't think the NP's are competent. Def opt for an MD. If you need hand-holding and want to ask a million questions, this is not the place for you. They kind of rush you thru things. \nI used to work for a dermatologist who really took the time and would answer questions. She was very competent.

I recently learned that it is against the law for a contractor to ask for more than 50 percent of the job before they comp the work.  So once I gave them the money then I had to chase them over and over again to complete the job. I am now done chasing and will be taking them to court as they literally stole my money because I now have to pay someone else to finish what they took my money to do. This contractor is very unprofessional and dishonest. I would not recommend them at all.",

Once I got home and began to eat I noticed most of my shrimp were NOT properly cleaned. There is no excuse for this. As much as it cost to dine at this place you should take the care to properly clean your food. We all know what's left there if you don't. I've never had this issue at the Lake Circle location. My bf also had a few that were not cleaned properly. This is very disappointing to say the least and I will not be returning to this location. Pictures for proof included.",
    "Updating my review, I had the \"house gel\" DO NOT Get this, it burned the crap out of my nail beds and is now making me wonder if this was really supposed to be used with a UV light.

    "To be honest their customer service was terrible. I called  and reserved  a spot for my birthday for Afternoon tea three weeks prior to my birthday. I called three times prior to make sure it was set and according to them it was. The day of my friends and I go, only to find out that they were double booked and had a wedding and my reservation was cancelled with no call whatsoever.  Their lack of communication has turned me off to ever going there in the future!",
    "I feel like I was punished going here.  Like what did I do wrong?  Stylist pretended like she couldn't understand a word I was saying so she just cut everything shorter with no technique or style. \n\n Picture below is what happens when you ask Rocket Science to get rid of the hair on your neck.  Ran a razor across one time and actually let me leave with that on my neck.  What did I ever do to you Kelsey?",
    "Our friends have been raving about the  bbq here so we decided to join them there. Another friend recommended getting there early because stuff sells out.

They hadn't even done a diagnostic on it. Two days later they told me that the vehicle didn't fall within the recall mileage frame. \n\nWhen I asked then why they didn't tell us this when we brought the car in I was told that the service rep (Giovanni) was new and he should have known better. \n\nI spoke with the service manager.

    "Decided to try this place tonight. We were told that our food would be out in 15 minutes. 45 minutes later it wasn't. There were people waiting even longer. At least be honest with your customers. Luckily you pay after you get your food, so we cancelled and went somewhere else. Seriously though, how long does it take to bring out BBQ? It's already made, all you have to do is put it on a plate and give it to someone.",
    "If I could give less than one star I would.  I have been waiting over a month for an appointment only to be called today saying the provider was taking the day off and I would need to move my appointment another month out! The receptionist who called me didn't even know her bosses name so that I could speak with her and was very unapologetic. Don't waste your time trying to be seen by this group.",

If it weren't for the girls in the back I could of walked out with my gun but they have a set time they stop running backgrounds which is fine but I have my CCW and they didn't want to do the work 30 minutes before closing because they are lazy. I suggest when gun shopping SNG on palo verde they will work pass the time to get you out with your gun!",
    "$6 Nail Trim.\n\nThis is most definitely a mom & pop place, the staff and atmosphere are super welcoming!\n\nCan't wait to get my dog groomed here instead of just nails!",
    "I don't get the hype. The space is super cute, but felt like their menu was a bit limited. I also didn't care for the biscuits really. Don't get me wrong, they were OK, but I was expecting borderline amazing. I think we might have been better off just grabbing sweets from the coffee counter and eating elsewhere. \n\nHighly recommend a reservation, especially on the weekends.",
    "So, I am back reviewing yet again.  Why?  Because I have been waiting for a month for two refunds from this group.  My insurance company paid about $2000 on Nov 16 and I can't get it refunded to me, plus they promised me a refund of $1400.   This group is very difficult to deal with.",

    "Service was okay. Very hard to communicate with. Did not confirm until night before I flew in. Business done via text which was uncomfortable for me. In my business this is unprofessional.

    "My review is for their philanthropy.  They opened their doors yesterday so that OneBrick and Yelp could prepare and serve meals to shelter residents from the area.  OneBrickers and Yelpers volunteered their time for one or more shifts...ranging from the dessert preparation on Wednesday night to prepping the dining room and preparing the meal to serving and clean up on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nI was there on Wednesday evening to help prepare desserts and again yesterday morning with my daughter to help prepare the meal and set up the dining room for the Thanksgiving feast.  The meal was prepared with all Indiana-grown products.\n\nThe locale is easy to find and I loved the vibe.  I'm going to make it a point to return to The Earth House Collective for the cafe experience.\n\nThanks to Indiana's Yelp Community Manager Jon A. and One Brick Indiananpolis Dana P. for making this happen.  And a big thank you to Wishard Hospital for donating the money to purchase the locally-grown food for the event.  I'm sure the shelter residents who were treated to a sit down meal, full on with hosts and hostesses, appreciated the event.",
    "Daaaaammmmmmnnnn. Their service is fast. I ordered a \"Gyro Pita\" with feta cheese, went to take a seat and LITERALLY got called to pick it up a minute later. \n\nSweet heyzeus. This gyro was ungodly good. The meat wasn't too salty or overly seasoned; it was also juicy without being too greasy. The toppings were fresh and sumptuous. I basically inhaled this in two minutes. \n\nThis place is a must if you love gyros as much as I do.",
    "This company is a rip off  I called for my air conditioner to have it diagnosed  charge me $79.00 July 2018 the supposed tech Ben B came 15 late and was very unfriendly and complained that he has to work at night he told me that the part will cost me $800.00 and it's a hardstart and run capacitor , ladies and gents they are available in Grainger cost $11.00  spp6 booter and $33.20 (2mef2) capacitor takes about  15 to fix if you are a rookie , so don't call this company they will rip you off",
    "I considered this the best KBBQ in Philly right now. The food, the service, and the atmosphere are great! \n\nSet A is more than enough for 2 people. The quality of meat is good, and I love the side dishes they offered. \n\nThe waiter was super nice and accommodating. They regularly checked on you and helped you grill the meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is very modern but still cozy. The restaurant is very new so I love how I did not smell like bbq food on me. \n\nI will definitely come back here again.",
    "So I went to Rooms To Go and purchase a king size mattress and box spring and it was supposed to be $987 plus tax. I use their Acceptance Now program which they did not disclose all of the fees they were charging me. While I was there filling out the paperwork for acceptance now the guy that I was dealing with Braden came and told the acceptance now guy to add the mattress protector and I asked them if the mattress protector cost any money and he said no it was included in the 987 plus tax. Come to find out they charge me an extra 69. 99. If you choose to shop here be careful when signing things because they are tricky and a scam.",

    "The food here isn't ANYTHING to write home about. The owners are awful. The servers aren't great either. Literally nothing is fresh. Everything is frozen or from a can. The owner loves to get drunk while the business is open and then micromanage her employees and yell at them in front of the customers. Nothing about this establishment is professional or good. I would never eat there again and anyone who ever asks if they should eat there I'm always sure to tell them absolutely not, don't waste your money.",

When I asked for extra they brought 3 more and charged an additional $3. They have some guts charging that much and for that alone I will never come back. $50 for two drinks and 4 ounces of guacamole you can have it.",

We were hesitant about the $70 per person price since the ride was ONLY 5 MILES to and from our starting point.  We fell for the tag line \"Arrive safe and in style.\"  However, we were shocked when a van, not a limo, came to pick us up.  When we told the driver politely that we thought we were getting a limo, she scoffed and said, \"not for that price!\" On the drive home, they had overbooked the \"limo\" and 10 of us had to cram in this van ($70 per person).

I know that most of the college students will vouch that 10 dollars is a lot and probably won't tip on top of that, but Jesus Christ. I understand the bartenders and waitresses were really hot, okay? That's fine-- I like staring, (This is why I give two stars) but god, having to hear a story about going to the gym and shopping made me remember why I left Miami, and I hate conversations that don't start with \"When I was fisted...\" Just get to the point.\n\n\nIf you're into divey, dingy, and dirty; then this place will make you barf all over the place.",

She also made sure to show my daughter how to play with their hair and be happy. I was very pleased and would love to take my daughter there again.",

And I'm sorry, steak should always be more than chicken. I mean, come on- it's chicken.\n  And don't even get me started about the flies. Luckily, I personally, did not get picked on by the flies for some reason. But my two companions were constantly being attacked by these flies.

They leave the pies out all day, and one Sunday, as I was walking to Trader Joe's from TJ Maxx, I noticed that they had a pizza sitting OUTSIDE, open to the air, next to the cigarette ash tray.

The roll was passable-- for like something you might buy in a supermarket, if that! The seaweed salad was totally inedible though. As in, it just didn't taste right at all. My friend's sushi didn't look particularly appetizing and when I asked her how it was she just looked at me and said, \"Eh.\"",

The shrimp and grits lacked that burst of flavor and tasted very bland to me. The macaroni dish looked unappetizing and tasted very bland as well.  Overall my table was not very happy with the food and i felt terrible for dragging them along with me to try it (why you gotta let me down like that Luke????) \n\nAnyway, I will not be returning nor recommending this place.",

OneBrickers and Yelpers volunteered their time for one or more shifts...ranging from the dessert preparation on Wednesday night to prepping the dining room and preparing the meal to serving and clean up on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nI was there on Wednesday evening to help prepare desserts and again yesterday morning with my daughter to help prepare the meal and set up the dining room for the Thanksgiving feast.  The meal was prepared with all Indiana-grown products.\n\nThe locale is easy to find and I loved the vibe.  I'm going to make it a point to return to The Earth House Collective for the cafe experience.\n\nThanks to Indiana's Yelp Community Manager Jon A. and One Brick Indiananpolis Dana P. for making this happen.  And a big thank you to Wishard Hospital for donating the money to purchase the locally-grown food for the event.  I'm sure the shelter residents who were treated to a sit down meal, full on with hosts and hostesses, appreciated the event.",

When we left, we were told that if we leave early, we would get a weeks rent back because the owners wanted to put the house on the market which we did.

My dog is not due for his annual for another five months and I did not really want to take him to another vet to get a refill on his prescription.

They kind of rush you thru things. \nI used to work for a dermatologist who really took the time and would answer questions. She was very competent. That being said, she stopped taking insurance, so Belle Meade is where I go now for convenience. However, I do feel they sometimes dismiss concerns.

( tried to say I didnt have money).Should have known the first day they showed up we were going to have an issue, claimed measurements were messed up.

    "Be careful\u200b if you use THLE. Once you hit the one year mark, and after they sell your loan to another company, you will have issues that will ultimately lead back to them. We had zero issues in the beginning, even referred friends to him but this was the icing on the cake.",
    "Signing up was easy, and Dave Ramsey recommends this service. Naturally, I hope I will never actually need their services, but if I do, it will be good to have a professional around to handle a identity theft crisis.",
    "If you want good Chinese in North Philly, come to Peking Garden. Temple Star is gross and sometimes China House on Cecil just doesn't cut it. It can be a trek to Susq and Broad but it's worth the trip.\n\nThe General Tso platter and egg rolls are delicious.",
    "Do not use this company! They are a scam and a rip off. They will make any excuse not to cover a claim and then have the nerve to tell you they are cancelling your policy.",

    "This review is coming super late but it's still worth mentioning. \n\nOrder came onto fast and HOT! The sauce from the cornbread was absorbed by the container but didn't leak out of the box! \n\nThe chicken hit the spot and I'll definitely make another visit when I'm in town again!",
    "Went there at the end of the day and had a facial with Heather it was very nice and relaxing. The spa was very clean and quiet.  The location was convenient and there was plenty of parking. Restrooms were clean also.",
    "NOT  going  to  go  into  a  long  detailed  story  about  this  place.  THAT  would  fill  a  novel.  I  will  say  I  have  ZERO  confidence  and  trust  in  this  place;  and  will   never  go  to  this  place  again.",
    "I have been going to Massage Green since it opened. The experience of the business is always great. Friendly, quiet and peaceful. I highly recommend Brooke, Todd and Angel as therapists. You won't be disappointed! It's always easy to get an appointment within 24-48 hours.",
    "I went to Bobs in Springfield PA.  The salesman Anthony Rizzo was clueless.   He was so slow and ended up making a mistake programming our order in the computer.  I received my bedroom furniture but the rest of the ordered was left out when they came.   They delivered on a Wednesday.  i requested that they return on Saturday to bring the rest of the order.  They would not.  There seemed to be an \"I dont care attitude\" for their mistake.  After charging over 200.00 for delivery you would think they would stand behind their promise.\nBobs Discount Furniture...you get what you pay for",
    "Ok for cuts.  Color, not so much.  Had highlights done here a while back that looked the same as when I walked into the salon.  And they are pretty pricey.",
    "Okay it was fresh, it was good, but I was hungry an hour later. These portions leave something to be desired, but man was it fresh! \n\nI ordered the trio with a cup of lobster bisque. The bisque was wonderfully creamy and delicious, the crab and lobster both sweet and full-flavored! You can't go wrong here!",

    "So I ordered salt and pepper shrimp and scallops through Yelp and was expecting to just run in and pick up; well bc they did not have scallops nothing was made. So I sat in the corner with my child and waited for my salt and pepper shrimp to be cooked. While the food was decent the restaurant appeared a bit unorganized, even in the area where you order, doubt I would return.",

I specifically drive to the Ford dealership in Carson to spare myself the headaches of the service advisors here. \n\n Never purchased a vehicle from this dealership so I can't say anything about their sales team. But the experience I've received pushes me to avoid this place at all costs.\n\n The parts department guys are cool. They'll help you find the part that you need no problem.",
    "Looking for something fun to do by the river walk? Try out the water bikes! It's definitely a workout, but worth it to see the views from the water side.\n\nWe booked and reserved our bikes online, i believe there is a discount if you do book online, but do not take my word for it. You have the option to have the bikes for 1 hour or 2. Honestly, 1 was good enough for me. Lol. There is no way you will tip over in the bike and there is a basket that will keep your belongings dry. The instructor will provide the instructions for you and areas you are allowed to go to. Very simple and easy. Just make sure you stay aware of boats, paddle boards, kayaks around you. Pretty sure you won't ever bump into them and boats are not allowed to go fast on the river as well. So you'll be safe. \n\nYou have the option to either bike alone or with a tandem. I'm glad i did the tandem with my husband, cause I'm pretty sure i would've given up if i was by myself. Haha.",

    "ALERT SCAM WARNING was contacted by this law firm after talking to an organization taking advantage of those applying for disability for my family member. The organization pretended to be with the SSI/disability office. Had to place a freeze on my credit with FCC. Taking advantage of a United States Veteran. Absolutely heartless and disgusting. They should be ashamed of themselves. And if they issue an apology under this review it is not sincere, they are just looking to cover up what they are guilty of.",
    "Four of us went in to enjoy the Purdue game and some beers.  We noticed all TVs were on Notre Dame game so we asked hostess(wearing a ND shirt) if they could turn one tv to the Purdue game.  She came back and said the manager said they would not turn one TV for us to watch Purdue.  We said \"OK\" and left. We live less than two minutes away and we will not be back.  My grandpa graduated from ND so I am a fan, but give me a break. #BoilerUp",

    "I stopped here because I always see specials on the board by the highway. The day I stopped in the special was one dollar drafts and 39 cent wings. I had the BBQ wings. You have to order 10 or more so I had ten. They were great!!!! The staff was very friendly and talkative. It only around the corner from where I live so I will stop back in for dinner or pizza and do a follow up rating!!! I like this place!!!!",
    "Once I figured out how to order it was all good. You use a pad to order and pay as you enter.the pho was very good but I felt bad that I couldn't take the leftovers with me since I was staying in a hotel. The summer rolls were also good but there was way too much to finish also. I will be back when I'm in the area but will be much more hungry when I arrive.",
    "Tani has been operating with 5-star food and 1-star service as long as I can remember, but it's finally not worth it. \n\nTonight's experience was a 30 minute wait for carry out that was prepaid and and scheduled for pickup. \n\nI just won't be back.",
    "When I moved in just about everything was broken, Internet, all the sinks, the dishwasher, it's as if they never even stepped foot in here before I did. Place is old, very basic, definitely not worth what I'm paying for it. Then the icing on the cake was when I called to ask where the dumpster was because I just walked a mile looking for it. The person who answered the phone actually said and I quote \"NO! Go ask one of your neighbors.\" Is that the kind of customer service I'm paying $3000 a month for??? In reality this place would be lucky to get $600 a month on a year lease. Turns out that this place has something called a valet trash, I'm from California I've never even heard of that nor did I know it existed and they couldn't even be bothered enough to tell me that. I would pass if you have the option...definitely took all the warm and fuzzy's out of my move to Tampa.",
    "There is a $99 service call which I found out is the highest in Boise. Then the service guy tells me it will be over $400 to replace my control board. Sounds serious  enough right? So I pay it only to later find out the board is a $70 part and it took him less than a hour to replace. Grrrr I am so mad at these people for taking advantage of me.",
    "It was pretty good.  Open on Sundays a plus but something about the place made me not ever go back.  Nothing bad just strange.",
    "The waiters are soooo nice (and cute.)\nOk, that said, let me tell you about the food. It is delicious! I highly recommend Evil Jungle Princess. It is absolutely amazing. And it's chicken! So it's cheap. \nThe desserts are unbelievable. They are gorgeous and taste even better. YOU MUST GET DESSERT HERE.",
    "I was not impressed. The lady at the desk acted like she didn't want to help with cake ideas and there is a kid in the party that had nut allergies. They said they couldn't guarantee it was nut free because of contamination.",
    "My experience with Olga's Services was confusing and stressful. There's a language barrier, but that has very little to do with the customer service itself. I felt like I was bothering them while trying to inquire about their availability and such. I wouldn't recommend.",
    "The ice latte was really good. I ordered the avocado toast on an everything bagel and a ham and cheese panini.  Both items were good. There is lots of room to read a book which they offer many to read from.",
    "Definitely do bot go here if you are a POC. It's sad that we still have to experience racism in business establishments in this day and age. The staff needs to be screened thoroughly!",
    "So disappointed by this place. Took my leather handbag in to be cleaned. I was told it was going to be sent out the day after it was dropped off and that it would be back in time for me to take it on my vacation. I get called the day it was supposed to be back, not to tell me it was back but to tell me it had never been sent out. 3 weeks it sat there before they called me! The lady that called was rude and couldn't tell me what happened or even offer an apology. What happened to customer service?! I'll drive out of my way to go anywhere but here now.",
    "This place is amazing. The coffee roaster, the sprawling brick walls, the train echoing in the distance. Tucson is a coffee culture and this is the pinnacle.",
    "The good: the pizza! The missing brick surely does pizza right. I visited with 6 girlfriends one Saturday night. I had the OG. It was delicious and made fresh to order. The garlic knots are good as well! \n\nThe portion size is very large. Share with a friend or save half for another day. \n\nThe have wine and beer available so grab a drink while you wait for your pizza. \n\nThe bad: they don't accept call in orders and are only open Thursday-Sunday. The pizza is made to order so it can take 20-30 minutes to be ready. It would be nice to order ahead to save time. Hopefully they will add that feature soon. \n\nI'll be back for sure.",
    "I brought in two pieces of jewelry. A Cartier love bangle and gold diamond earrings. The man seemed very disinterested and told me the bracelet was a fake and offered me $20 bucks for the earrings. I left and paid to have it appraised and received over $3,000. If your looking to sell here it's unreliable and unreasonable. They don't know anything about jewelry.",
    "This place is amazing like always food was fresh and delicious the ambiance is wonderful the wait time was a little slow today probably short on staff in the back today but this is a homage to food made in Germany the closest you can get with out using your passport !",
    "DO NOT PICK THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!Scheduled an appointment on Monday for Saturday. Saturday comes no one showed up. Receptionist called said the tech was backed up with a job. We would be first on Sunday. Sunday comes , receptionist calls again at 5:22pm and says that someone is still scheduled to come out. Now it's 8pm, no one has showed up. No one has called. I've been waiting two days now for someone to show up. Company couldn't provide a window for service because the company has no idea if and when a tech will be available. I don't normally leave reviews, but if this saves someone waiting in Louisiana heat it is worth it. I WARN YOU AGAIN: DO NOT PICK THIS COMPANY!!!!",
    "I've had probably every ramen place in Philadelphia (Chinatown,CC, NoLibs, Fishtown) searching for a place that competes with Los Angeles ramen and THIS is it. If you're looking for ramen that is just as good if not better than LA ramen, come here! You will not be disappointed.",
    "Coming from AZ I thought I would have a problem using my pass here but I was wrong. Had no complications. Cee is awesome! She is very fast which helps with the pain but she is sooo thorough! Clean Brazilian done in 15 mins. I can't complain. EWC is always so clean & sanitary..that is always a plus.",
    "Stop everything and eat here now. Their plates are so pretty it's hard to eat them. Just kidding, it's so delicious it's not a problem. I could eat here daily. Everything is amazing. Just go.",
    "The manager is walking around speaking with customers. I think he saw me with my YELP app out but nevertheless he was talking with everyone. That's Great! I asked about their opening and congratulated him on their move to our area... as I'm waiting look what he brings: G. R. I. T. S. \none of my favorites.\nOh and my foods here. Cornedbeef hash with biscuit and poached egg, ahhh but no butter for either my grits nor biscuit... rookie mistake, but I'm forgiving",
    "SO SLOW! We waited over 50 minutes for our car to arrive, despite initially being told it would only take a few minutes. When I called to inquire, the person who answered was rude and curt. I certainly will never be using this service again and would caution anyone else who's considering.",

    "Food was great. Went for lunch it was packed. In terms of location a little far uptown from where I live but close to my job. Not convinced I would leave my house for the sandwich but would to another working lunch meeting. Service was attentive, funny and patient.",
    "I made an appointment a week in advance. Gave them my insurance info. The day before they called me saying they lost it and I needed to bring in my member handbook to show what my insurance pays for- so they know what work they can do! \n\nI have never in my life been asked to do the office managers job at any dentist or Doctor. Ridiculous!! I read these reviews after I made the appointment, and I was reluctant. I cancelled my appointment- you shouldn't make one! They suck!!",
    "I went here with a gift card. Luckily I did because I was not happy with my massage. I was suppose to get an hour and a half massage but ended up with maybe an hour...if that. There was a group of girls at the front that were talking about another coworker and being very unprofessional. I had Keila and she seemed like she didn't want to work. But if I cancelled I was afraid of being charged. I told her it was cold and asked if she can get the room warmer but she didn't. And to top that off the massage was awful. I was in pain for two weeks. I've had plenty of massages. But never one this bad. I will not return.",
    "Tried this place after my disaster at Adorable Nails and could not have been happier. Decided on Bio Gel this time and it is amazing. They are very friendly and explain everything when you have questions. This is my go to place from now on.",

Thats what this kmart is to me.  possibly the worst run and worst staffed kmart ever.  i have no idea how any kmart is in business but especially this one.  \n\ni tell myself im not going in and wind up getting sucked in because i need something and the walmart and target are 10 miles away.  and i go and cant find what i need.\n\ni am volunteering to push the 'deploy' button for implosion.  please sell or go out of business.",
    "The service department is awful. My service rep advised me that it would take two weeks to perform a recall service on my daughters car. \n\nWhen I called after 16 days they had not touched it. They hadn't even done a diagnostic on it. Two days later they told me that the vehicle didn't fall within the recall mileage frame. \n\nWhen I asked then why they didn't tell us this when we brought the car in I was told that the service rep (Giovanni) was new and he should have known better. \n\nI spoke with the service manager. He's a joke too. His name is Darrell. \n\nBe sure to get any agreement in writing before committing to service with this business.",
    "So, I take my son to guitar center to buy some accessories for his drum set and guitar. Each room in the store is separated by types of instrument and equipment. \n\nWe headed back to the percussion room and waited 15 minutes for help while the \"percussion expert\" talked on the phone and went out of his way not to glance at us or acknowledge we were there or even let us know he would be with us shortly. He also made no attempt to show any urgency to get of the phone. \n\nEventually,  we went to the front of the store to snag someone from another department to help us.  When we got back to the percussion room, he was conveniently off of the phone.  He helped us and  seemed knowledgeable about his department. But, I was too annoyed to care.   At that point, I just wanted to get the stuff and get out.  \n\nIf I wanted to feel like I was at the Royale, I would've gone there.  At least I would have had a seat while I waited for someone to act interested that we were there.",
    "**update**\nHow much MSG did you put in the noodle? I'm very very thirsty after having them!\n\n-----\n\nI really really want to like this place. The waiter told me the noodle here is handcrafted. I think speaking from a quality standpoint. The noodle itself is not bad. But I don't know what's wrong with the chief today. They are so overcooked the noodle. It almost turn into a oatmeal bowl. And both dishes I ordered look nothing like the picture on the menu. In addition, the shrimp in the noodle taste a little funky. I think because it has already turned bad. Aiyaya..",
    "[506]\n\nThe food here is great so you will always get a quality product.\n\nCustomer service is hit or miss.

I asked  for a price she said I don't know , I have to answer the phone it is probably  about 40 something.  When I  came to pick up my order  I  asked to speak to the manager. When I  told the manager  what happen he started laughing  and said oh. The lady said something  in Chinese  and they both started  laughing.  I never experienced customer  service like that before.  The food is not the same as if was  before.",

    "ALLIGATOR\n\nI was determined to try alligator meat. Towards the end of the trip, we came to Felix's where they serve alligator 2 ways, blackened and fried.\n\nMy friend and I chose blackened since they wouldn't let us do half-half. \n\nThe portion was quite small for $12. The meat itself was not bad, a cross between fish and chicken. But it was overloaded with spices that made it very salty and unappealing.",

Although I was raised just minutes away from Primos, I didn't fully appreciate it till I moved to the West Coast, a land where hoagie is not even considered a word.\n\nNow, every time we visit, I manage to plow down a hoagie a day, sometimes two, just to make sure I get my fill.  We also bring at least 4 hoagies back with us on the plane just to savor Primo's Hoagies a bit longer.",
    "This diner is amazing because it's a favorite for the locals. I've been going here since I was nine years old. The owners and waitress makes you feel like you personally know each other and like you're family. Everything in this place taste amazing and fresh. The corn beef hash is a local favorite that it even runs out. The atmosphere and interaction makes this place great!",

After lighting the candle there is absolutely zero scent.  NOTHING.  Even standing next to it.  My husband even asked if it was unscented. Disappointing, I was really excited and wanted to love the brand, but for a candle to be that expensive, I need to to smell good while burning.",

    "AVOID for service. I recently got an oil change and was charged an extra $5.29 for \"Misc. Charges\" which I was told was for \"rags used during my service\". Since when are rags used during an oil change not the cost of doing business? That's like a restaurant adding a surcharge on my bill for the pots and pans used while cooking my meal. Absurd.\n\nCar sales are likely fine because a car is a car.",
    "We walked in and noticed quite a renovation since the old Pizza Hut! We waited quite some time for our drinks and had to ask 2-3 times for limes for my drink. Then once we got dinner we waited about 10 mins for our tortillas to arrive (which were part of our meal). My husbands dinner which was supposed to have mushrooms didn't. Slightly disappointed, food lacking flavor and my bacon wrapped shrimp was freezer burned. Water was not refilled until we asked. Guadalajara Grill here we come!",
    "This is probably ranked the number 1 spot that I tend to go too for Tea every time I am in Chinatown. Everyone I knows, comes here and it's like a reunion. Super busy, but flowing. Crowded at times, but not too congested so you'll have room to maneuver. I haven't tried the food so I can't rate on it. The drinks are consistent. Wish they came with a loyalty program though.",
    "The classes are ok. I like that they're fairly small.  But I've been trying to cancel my membership for 3 months now with no response.  DO NOT JOIN as a member.  It's next to impossible to get them to cancel the membership.  If you go, pay as you go or buy packages.",

I told the staff the refund and cancel of membership,  and they just kicked the ball to each other. So still nothing has changed. Wish things can come around today later.",
    "Taqueria el mariachi is a place i drove 45 mins to go to. it's worth the ride. The place is known for Pupusas which are grilled patties with cheese in them served with pickled cabbage. They are a knockout. 10 of 10. The chicken tacos are the best I've ever had. I've had a lot. They use chicken right off the bone in fat chunks. The quesadillas are unique almost like a panzarotti. This place is in somewhat of a doo doo environment but it's cool parking up and being in and out. I wouldn't suggest anyone doing footloose up Olden Ave.",
    "Don't be deceived by the exterior as this place including the staff are terrible! \nMy Labrador came out with a hunk missing out of his nose. \nI brought his dog food that was pre packed in zip lock bags for each feeding and they charged to feed it to him. \n\nI requested a bath before pick up... just a bath and nothing more!! \nThese people charged me 50.00 for a bath only!!! \n\nThe staff has the personality of my sack and I wouldn't take any animal I love the this crap hole!! \n\nDo not take your loved pet to this establishment!!",

    "Crap service. Bartender sucks. My wife and I stood in front of the bartender for 5 minutes and he never even acknowledged that we were standing there. There were 5 people in the bar. I took my wife to the car and went back to tell the bartender that it's rude to ignore a paying customer and he threatened to call the police. That's exactly what I expected him to say. If there was less than one star I would have chosen that option. I will never go back there and if you're smart you'll avoid this place at all costs.",
    "I arrived at the animal hospital at 9:45am. I left at 2:15pm. That is ridiculous. I don't understand why this place accepts walk ins when they can barely keep up with the people who have appointments. Not worth it. Unless you don't mind waiting for hours.",

    "Like the Hotel California - you can join but you can never cancel. Jordan the manager is the only one who can cancel your membership. He can't do it over the phone. He isn't in on weekends. He doesn't get in until 9 am during the week and leaves at 5 so if you have a job you have to take time off to go in and see him. Then when you get there he may be gone making a deposit at the bank so you have to wait 20 minutes for him to get back. If you join - don't plan on canceling.",
    "Incompetent, condescending & rude. Never have I ever been spoken to the way Mike Powelson spoke to me. I wouldn't send anyone to this individual ever. Learn some manners & respect! Plenty of businesses that are out there, that can do the job well, but not this one.",
    "Well Jan's has a bunch of dresses on her website, but she can't even get them all!! My mom found a dress she loved on her website that Jan probably hasn't been able to get in years!!! She was extremely rude and tried telling me what my mother would like instead of talking to me about what she likes! I would not recommend this store to anyone!!! Also, the sales girls were scared to go into the office and were chatting about people getting fired...",
    "Dr Kim and the girls in the front are cool, but they REFUSE to give pain meds. Even after root canals, fillings or crowns. They judge and make you feel like a crackhead even for asking. Sorry I just spent over $4,000 with you out of pocket (very expensive), how dare I ask to be comfortable? So frustrating. I'll pay off my plan and go elsewhere.",
    "I paid 30 dollars for this?? I live in Germantown and was really excited to try this place. SO DISAPPOINTED. This was the portion size for an entree that was 27 dollars!!! Will not be coming back.",

    "Very good!\nI went off the reviews for this place, and I was pleasantly happy.  The wings are to die for.  The chicken cheesesteak was chopped up chicken breast, not pulverized wanna-be chicken.  Pizza is very good too.  The quality shows, and I  Can't wait to order from them again.",

    "I'm never shopping at this store ever again! I had a problem with an employee but when I went to report that person to the manager, she was very rude on the phone and acted like she could care less. I find most of the employees to be rude and unhelpful. I think I will go to a different Walmart where the Employees are much nicer! Walmart customer service is going down hill more and more!",
    "Well this time our lunch was a disappointment. \n\nWe sub the steamed rice for fried rice which was a mistake.\n\nThe fried rice must have been made in the am and literally left out . It was cold and well terrible. \n\nMy pepper steak was super super spicy and real tough. My wife's chicken dish was nothing to rave about. \n\nWhat a lack of consistency. \n\nGo elsewhere if your graving oriental.",

I paid two months premiums -- $650.00 each, only to get a cancellation notice in the mail, telling me I hadn't paid!

    "My boyfriend and I have been bringing our one and a half year old Goldendoodle here for his groomings since we got him at 11 weeks, and we would never, ever take him anywhere else! We could not love The Dog Groomery more! Christy and her helpers are so good with him, and they go above and beyond to fit us into their schedule. Sebastian gets beyond excited when he realizes where we are going, and he pulls so hard to get through those doors! We love y'all! They even made him look so dapper today with a tie :) I highly recommend The Dog Groomery to everyone.",
    "The management is abusive. Don't  complain about the riff raf or the abusive  staff or they will kick you out. If you're a lowlife crack person that doesn't have a job that's living off of the government you're okay!!!\nDo  whatever you want!!!",
    "they are simply unreliable, ordered food for the sabbath, they forgot to bring a couple of items including Grapejuice  for Kiddush. Some of their salads (egg salads ) were unedible... honestly you probably dont have much of a choice but candidly if you have options I would look somewhere else. I hate saying this since I really want to see folks succeed but really this was unacceptable",
    "If you have a problem, dont expect them to actually call you back when told they will.... Maybe If you call the Vape or smoke or whatever kind of tobacco shop the owner also owns (the irony) you might actually get to talk to him and get a resolution. Im going on a week now with no resolution... And lets see how comfortable it will be to go to any classes to finish out my purchase.",
    "Not only were the bartenders rude, they were inappropriate with the ladies that accompanied us to the establishment. When figuring out where we were going for the night, I ignored the people that said the place was elitist. Unfortunately, the assholes staffing the place have proved me wrong. I will never come back and I hope I can convince others not to either.",
    "I had these guys come over to pressure wash and stain my deck. I want to warn anyone about this company. \n\nThey did the job well enough (not great), but at a premium in terms of price. That would not have been so bad, except they damaged my property to the tune of $200. The owner eventually made an appearance over a week after our compaint, and proceeded to take notes and be super curt and rude, no resolution yet.\n\nThat STILL would not have been so bad, except for the contractor was so rude and obnoxious that I came home to my wife in tears, she was so upset. I would pay twice the amount to a company that would treat my property and my family with decency and respect. These guys do NOT.",

    "I just want to say thank you!  The team was quick and efficient!  I was very pleased with the work they did and I will definitely call them back to work for me again!",
    "Being from Ca, its hard to match or beat our quality.  Product looked good but tasted like it had been dried/cured to quick.  Hence I feel I overspent and now have buyers remorse.\n\nWhoever your suppliers are, you should audit and check quality and methods.\n\nUpdate:  Chemdog is righteous.  Bluberry cookies was where I had an issue.",
    "If I had reviewed this place as I had remembered it in the past, it would have been a solid 4.  The meal I had tonight was not only average in flavor, but in some dishes was overcooked and in others undercooked.  I don't recognize the new Le Virtu, at all.",

    "Had lunch here with my son, We both ordered burgers and a shake. The shake was delicious. I have to say we overheard the delivery person say something about that is how his grandmother scrapes off the burnt on the bun when it is burnt. That would be my son's burger. When we finished I asked for a slice of carrot cake to go. The woman took the chef's knife that he cuts chicken and burgers with sliced the cake, and then wiped it off with the rag she cleans the tables and counter with. Enough said.",
    "This place never runs on time and never notifies their patients that they are running behind.   The excuse is always \"we had an emergency come up\". This truly makes you feel like your time is NOT important.  A phone call before you arrive would be GREATLY appreciated or letting you know the minute you walk in the door. Second can't get information sent to me that I requested.  Information was requested via e-mail on 11/21/13 and still not response.",
    "My friend and I made appointments here for a pedicure on a friday afternoon in the summer- so it was obviously a little crowded. However, we signed in, picked our colors, and were taken back to the chairs pretty quickly. \n\nThe salon was clean, bright, and relaxing- it was pretty quiet but they also had signs up saying no yelling. The pedicure itself was good although I felt like they were trying to push up to get an upgraded pedicure and do a manicure as well. \n\nThey also have a rewards card system, but I believe you have to pay cash for it to count. I liked this place, but it is a little out of the way for me so I don't think it will become my go-to pedicure spot.",
    "I'm not paying $8-9 for just half a sandwich, and have to order a side of something else to fulfill my hunger.  We waited forever for our food, but noticed every one of the employees were standing around talking to each other.  The food is average, but i definitely would not go there again.",
    "They are the worst. My delivery West posted be here 3 weeks ago. They told me it would be delivered on a Friday from 9 to 1 PM. They didn't show up or call me.

Speaking of not on the menu, they've also made me a grilled shrimp banh mi when I just couldn't do fried.  I also like their bun and the curry (which states is a shrimp broth). The spring rolls are solid as well.\n\nI do a lot of takeout since this is near work. But if I dine in, I always prefer the patio.

    "I think this is worth the drive out of the city. They have tons of lanes, an arcade with air hockey and a bar/restaurant that is attached if you want food for your lanes.\n\nIt's about $5 a game, and you probably won't have to wait too long. They also have babysitting and you can go anytime (it's 24 hours). The post 3 a.m. crowd gets kinda' weird though.",

All I wanted to have done was someone install the bracket for a powerpole, not the powerpole itself; I can do that.  just the bracket.  Had to explain it to the lady three times, before she told me she couldn't commit anyone to it...  WHAT!?!  I only need you because you have a lifting ring to attach to the motor so you can slide the bracket between the motor and the transom.  That's it...  And I explained that.  Still too much for her service department to handle.  Guess they are all that incompetent.\n\n\nRidiculous",

In each case I pointed out stains on dress shirts and in each case they missed them and then pressed the stains into the shirts which ruined the shirts.  \n\nThe staff has no interest in hearing about it and tends to blame coworkers for the problems....clearly the owner is not engaged in the business and I have never seen an owner there.",

Isasa answered all my questions with a smile and eager to explain each dish. Summer was very attentive and on top of serving all the customers in a very fast paced environment. \n\nI also love that they had a t.v. that displayed their dishes so you can see what the entree would look like. \n\nI will definitely be visiting this place again.",
    "Dr. Stephanie Burris is amazing, and if this review was only about her I would have given her 5+ stars. Unfortunately, her receptionist is the reason I won't be going back. More often that not, she is rude, abrasive and just unfriendly in general. I've put up with it for about a year, but I won't be returning.",
    "I definitely would recommend this dealership for anyone in the area. They really treat you with respect and don't try to sell you things you don't need. If you just need an oil change that's what you get, without having to worry are they going to sell me everything under the sun.  For a dealership to be around for 91 yrs.

What I do expect is a cup of coffee that doesn't make me sick.\n\nThe coffee was downright disgusting to the point where we threw it out. It tastes like it was made a day earlier.... Hey DD, \"time to make the coffee!\" \n\nIt was obvious the person behind the counter was new because when I ordered blueberry flavor they had to ask a manager if they had that. Plus, he was so confused he asked the manager if she could make it for me, she refused and said it was easy and just pointed to where things were.

Two days later they told me that the vehicle didn't fall within the recall mileage frame. \n\nWhen I asked then why they didn't tell us this when we brought the car in I was told that the service rep (Giovanni) was new and he should have known better. \n\nI spoke with the service manager.

Coffee was good salad was just ok for $11 (I think) the guy at the counter said 20 mins for the cheese plate . So we wait. It comes out and wow!!!! 5 cheeses and a lot. It was big enough for 4. All the cheeses were perfect. The board was gorgeous. Nuts,fruit , mustard, honey. Stunning! Very worth it. The cheese guy rocked it. I let him choose. It's the way to go.",

The place is a dive and thats cool buts its DIRTY......thats different from \"dive-y\".\n\nThe food was horribly dry/old/reheated and totally lackluster. Always ask before you spend 10 minutes looking at the menu because half the stuff is not available! This place is not what you see on TV. It was sooo disappointing......I was literally shocked at the quality.\n\nDont expect the \"chef\" to be \"cooking\" your food.....someone else will be reheating your food. \n\nThe attitudes from the staff at this place did not come across as \"characters\" but more like \"We dont care and we dont need your business\".\n\nYou WILL need to check your bill!",

I was in a sort of a rush to get out of the dealership as my wife started to feel ill about halfway through the paperwork. Basically I was fed a line of crap and when I tried to use the warranty I couldn't because it was out of specs. Please don't get taken like I did, demand a list of rules or a booklet about the warranty if you get one. I feel like I was ripped off by this guy that knew I was trying to get out of there.

I understand that they just opened but seriously get it together. The food tastes like over seasoned Taco Bell. The beans and rice are disgusting! I do not recommend this Cantina at all.",

    "Came here for drinks, chips and guacamole before heading to dinner. Guacamole was $15 and although good, it only came with three tostados. When I asked for extra they brought 3 more and charged an additional $3. They have some guts charging that much and for that alone I will never come back. $50 for two drinks and 4 ounces of guacamole you can have it.",

    "Absolutely horrible. Not only was the lawn service poor, the guy who would mow our lawn decided that instead of knocking on my door and asking me to let him into the backyard, he would just pry the wood planks off my gate to get to the lock. Not only that, he had a habit of not closing the gate afterwards (even though there was a gaping hole from where he pried off the planks, so he could easily lock the gate behind him), so my dog would escape the yard and we had to run around to find her.  We had to pay to get the gateway fixed. We were not amused.\n\nEdit: typo",

He also made no attempt to show any urgency to get of the phone. \n\nEventually,  we went to the front of the store to snag someone from another department to help us.  When we got back to the percussion room, he was conveniently off of the phone.  He helped us and  seemed knowledgeable about his department. But, I was too annoyed to care.

Pizza was fresh and hot and incredible and could see the oven in the background. Staff was very good about keeping pens for signing sanitized, so I appreciated the details to safety. I enjoyed the food a LOT and will be back.",
    "It's very unique that is for sure. I'm all for gimmick places but if I wasn't drunk when I saw the portion sizes come out I would have said something. Looking back at it, it is a gimmick place so you should check it out so you have IG content for like months... Lots of places to take pictures. The DJ was fun and everyone was dancing like we were at a club.",

We were  taken to our table, given menus, and told our server would be right with us. Well, that was a joke. 10 minutes of just sitting there, with not a soul acknowledging us, we got up to leave. As we were leaving a server asked if we'd been helped, but it was too little too late. We won't go back, there's no excuse for that kind of neglect. Especially when it wasn't that busy. Four servers just hanging out by the bar, I just don't understand.",
    "I love Everest. I have been here during their lunch buffet and for dinner. Their lentil soup is incredible! I want to say what is good about it before I go into the not so good. \n\nWhat loses the star is the service during dinner.  At first it was great. They explained the menu, the food came out quick, everything was good. Problems started when it hit 8:30. They started mopping, turned off the music and turned on a TV in the bar area--basically straight up closing while we are still eating. For a moment I thought they closed at 8:30. If that was the case, I would completely understand them closing around us, but they did not close until 9:00! Not cool.\n\n\nAgain, I really like Everest. I will go again both for the lunch buffet and dinner. BUT if something like that happens again, I do not think I will return.",

I was quoted $6200 for a transmission from Lexus, and Tampa Hybrids tested and found it that it wasn't actually the transmission but the inverter. Cost was dramatically less ($1200).  Work was done quickly and I am back on the road .  Very pleased with the service and reliability.",
    "Not even a star! I stopped today and i bought a little of everything. Nothing was fresh! My mouth is cut from the lobster tail! The puff cream was completely disgusting.

    "Chase decided to accelerate my interest rate and not notify me. After I spoke to a representative they told me that my interest rate would remain at 0% for another 7 months, and once I saw my bill, it was at 9%. The Chase manager said all he could do was apologize and suggest I just close the account. Chase is such a shame, I have all of my lines of credit and checking accounts with Chase. They clearly don't value customer relations.",
    "I have been a customer for over year, and they let my dog escape.  They of course blamed the dog not the lack of supervision. They told us not to come back,  which I find quite rude.",

    "Absolutely horrible. Not only was the lawn service poor, the guy who would mow our lawn decided that instead of knocking on my door and asking me to let him into the backyard, he would just pry the wood planks off my gate to get to the lock. Not only that, he had a habit of not closing the gate afterwards (even though there was a gaping hole from where he pried off the planks, so he could easily lock the gate behind him), so my dog would escape the yard and we had to run around to find her.  We had to pay to get the gateway fixed. We were not amused.\n\nEdit: typo",
    "CAUTION: Do not buy a gift certificate! They have a SEVEN day cancellation policy and politely but firmly refused to make an exception for the flu. So we're out a Christmas present we've waited months to redeem because of this, and are unenthusiastic about spending the balance if their policies are this unhelpful.",
    "After hearing all about five guys forever, being called the in n out of the East Coast I had to try it. Let's just say it's not in n out, not even close. This place is disgusting.

    "So, UPS definitely dropped a package off there because UPS gave me the tracking number that usps gave them. My package then sat there for a week before I came in to the post office and asked for it and they said UPS probably never dropped it off. How about stop stealing packages and do your job.",
    "My sons Toyota Prius broke down in New Orleans while traveling through from Alabama.  I had it towed to Lakeside.  They looked at the vehicle and said they would have to get the \"Hybrid Tech\".  I waited until Monday only to be questioned about the salvage title.  They said the computer would not work to tell them what was wrong and whatever it was would be exspensive.  \n\nI told them I would have the car picked up and brought back to Tuscaloosa where I knew my repair shop here would not try and rip me off.  My man who picked up the vehicle could get no assistance from anyone to help load it.  As soon as the started it and drove it across their parking lot he knew it was the transmission.  When he dropped it at the shop in Tuscaloosa they also knew instantly it was the transmission.  They did not need the computer to tell them the obvious.\n\nLet's hope their is someone in the Crescent City that is better than Lakeside.  I would give Lakeside no stars but Yelp does not have that option.",

They made 4 appointments (scheduled/cancelled, repeat) in one week! They can't do what they say they can do. Sorry I tried them, I had another service that COULD do it, but lost my appt with them bc I thought Lawn Love seemed  easier to use? Also, when I finally called to ask if they could just pick a date they could stick to, no matter how far out, woman said she didn't know, said she'd have a supervisor call me (who never did), then I got an email saying they were cancelling my account.",
    "Been here, eaten that. But tonight?! Tonight was AMAZING! Tyler, our waiter, was spot on. He made sure we were all happy and fully fed. The best part-- chose a wine that hit every note and saved my wine rep with my aunt! My cousin needs gluten free and after eating the strawberries, Tyler brought out a GF cheesecake for her. So accommodating and hospitable-- not to mention the food was fantastic. Very pleased.",

    "Confusing. On the edge of the middle of nowhere. Awesome. \n\nThe sunsets, the walking trail, the dolphins, the manatees, and the pools make this place unbeatable. Of course it is a drive anywhere from here and a $25 cab from South Tampa, but hey, you can afford it if you can afford a Post Apartment.",

As we were leaving a server asked if we'd been helped, but it was too little too late. We won't go back, there's no excuse for that kind of neglect. Especially when it wasn't that busy. Four servers just hanging out by the bar, I just don't understand.",

I asked for a table for one and was directed to the bar, I was not given another option. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Salad croissant, and waited.. and waited.. people were sat after me, and got their orders before me. When the bartender asked me how things were, I said I didn't know, I'd not gotten my food... It'd been over 30 minutes at this point.  \n\nWhen the food did come out, at 35 minutes, it was ok, nothing amazing but I ate it and paid for it without complaint.  Its usually my favorite but it seems they may have changed the recipe.",
    "This place is awesome and does not disappoint!! My daughter and I drove to Vampire Penguin on a Monday during the day the week before school started. I heard about them on the Palm Harbor Happenings Facebook page.\n\nTheir shaved ice is so light and creative. The staff was extremely friendly.  I got the tuxedo which is chocolate shaved ice with strawberries and marshmallows.  My daughter got the pina colada which had pineapple and coconut shavings.  WOW they were both delicious.  We both got a small which was plenty for us.  We will definitely be back.\n\nPlease build another one in Palm Harbor!",
    "We had the truck at an event on my college campus. The food was good, but not worth $10 a pop. The man running the truck was rude to the people who invited him to be at the event. He literally was begging for business. Do not have this truck at an even if you do not want someone who is rude to the people there.",
    "This place never runs on time and never notifies their patients that they are running behind.   The excuse is always \"we had an emergency come up\". This truly makes you feel like your time is NOT important.  A phone call before you arrive would be GREATLY appreciated or letting you know the minute you walk in the door. Second can't get information sent to me that I requested.  Information was requested via e-mail on 11/21/13 and still not response.",
    "We have been looking forward this place opening up for awhile but to actually go inside we will have to wait till after corona is over but today we grabbed one of their sandwiches. The iron lung sounded so interesting with Nutella, manchego and chorizo on sourdough bread. It was interesting!  The flavors were really good but for me it had a bit too much Nutella on it.  Overall still awesome and can't wait to work my way through the menu.  Also looking forward to joking the wine and cheese club!",
    "I'm never shopping at this store ever again! I had a problem with an employee but when I went to report that person to the manager, she was very rude on the phone and acted like she could care less. I find most of the employees to be rude and unhelpful. I think I will go to a different Walmart where the Employees are much nicer! Walmart customer service is going down hill more and more!",
    "Not impressed! Went in for a refill. Amy, the technician was extremely rough, cut me twice and kept pulling my hands. I asked for coffin shape and they looked square, I explained how I wanted them, so she filed a little more, but they still came out looking square and also much shorter than I wanted from all the filing. After less than 24 hours a nail started to come off. I went back and she fixed it again very roughly. She picked a color that was close to my shade but not exact and insisted it was the same. I will not be returning!",
    "Unfortunately I had a chance to work with this agency and person. It already has been more then 5 month from the day I worked with this agency and I still didn't get paid.  I got a notice that I will get paid on August 14th. Well I am getting this kind of emails from him all this time and it is obvious that it might be just another delay. Anyway if I will not get paid  this month my lawyer will contact Roger Knauer and I hope all together we will turn him in to the authorities !",
    "I've gone 3 times now. The experience is different depending on which of the people work on you. But you can't get much better for the amount you pay. You can choose between a table massage, a chair massage (what you see in the mall), and foot reflexology. I think the minimum for the table and foot reflexology is 30 minutes ($35). Just tell them how deep/hard you want your pressure to be, and they'll adjust. You won't get the ambience you get at a day spa, but it's just as relaxing!",
    "This review is solely for the wax/esthetician. If you want a quick and dirty brazilian, then go here. I went one time, was walked into the room and paying the bill within 8 minutes. I felt weirdly violated in a way. The things that bothered me was that the esthetician was blowing on the wax, which felt unsanitary. Then after she was done, she just left the room. I was not offered a mirror to check out the job and she didn't tweeze any remnants she missed. So to pay 50$ for a less than 5 minute service felt like a complete rip off.",
    "I never met a Starbuck's that I didn't like.  Until this one.  They were shorted staffed the morning that we visiting.  Apparently, an employee had wandered off, leaving the other to fend for herself.\n\nService was decent considering.  Our beverages were good, but seriously, I was almost no longer in the mood.  That's how long it took to get them.",

    "Came to this location with my friend to buy some apple bites. When we walked in it was very clean and organized, smelled great.

    "I called the office before i went in and told them my purpose for wanting an appointment. Then when i got there they told me they wouldn't write me the prescription that i wanted. I have zero health issues and know that this prescription is written regularly so i was confused. Then they charged me $108. I didn't see a doctor or get a prescription. Very dissatisfying.",
    "I love ordering their veggie nachos (not on the menu, but ask for nachos with grilled veggies).  I'm a meat eater all the way, but this is so delicious!!!  And if you're feeling decadent... ask for it to be topped with plantains.

I think that people know who to go in New Orleans for their plumbing, heating, and AC needs, and that is Pete's Plumbing & Heating.\n\nVery happy to have finally found a group of people that are genuinely interested in serving their customers. I will definitely keep on using this company in the future.",

But, was never let on to all the Ala Cartes, that made the bill $351. My advice get pricing in writing, first. \n\nI'm sure they wouldn't like it if they were in a restaurant and were asked if they would like a mint. Then see $5 dollars on the bill.\n\nNot very happy.",

We have saved oodiles of money on vet visits alone! The staff is just about always nice. There are a few people who are at the desk who are always less then friendly. Dr. Merkle is by far my fav! She always gives us options when it comes to caring for our pups and has even taken us in to see us at the end of a night (Our pup cut his pads off on a garden planter). Tim, Petra and Marissa always go above and beyond when we are there! Some of them even know our voices on the phone when we call :)",

The 20 minutes went by fast though; Anju and I chatted it up and she even knew the place I went to Orange County, CA!\n\nWill definitely come back!",

Today,  I can finally say that my hair is healthy again. \n\nWhat I was not aware of immediately in the days following my visit was that my scalp was damaged. Because the color was left on my hair so long - and in globs, my scalp needed medicated shampoo and treatments to repair the damage done that day. It also took more than two months to completely remove the color from my scalp, earlobes, the skin behind my ears, and the back of my neck - it looked horrible.  \n\nNINE months to healthy. Find a salon and stylist that you love and avoid this salon. Your hair and scalp will thank you!",

    "Let's just say I don't get impressed easily, but I was totally amazed at the service from Geaux Maids. Jerry was punctual and worked for hours to deep clean my home before a family visit for Easter. Jerry went above and beyond, and I'll be recommending them to all my friends and family.",
    "I can't say anything good for the office ladies. They are rude and make the impression of doing you a favor by talking to you.  You will spend a while till someone asks you why you're there. I don't recommend using their service if you tend to appreciate your time and nerves.",

I have gone here twice, not by choice either time, but as a tag along with some friends and I have no idea how they stomach it let alone enjoy it. \n\nLet me just key you in on a lil something here, everything is pre-made. Nothing is made fresh. It's like they buy all the stuff and just take it out of the package, heat it up, and serve it. Its so gross. I'd rather not eat anything than eat here. And it's not just that a few things are gross here - EVERYTHING is gross here. The salad, the chicken products, the seafood, the beef, the sushi, the desserts, the soups, EVEN THE ICE CREAM is repulsive. \n\nIt's hard to say anything could be worse than McDonalds..but this...is worse than Mcdonalds.",
    "I could say lots of things about how they tried to lie and steal from me, or the attitude I received when I noticed it as I was walking to get my car, but I won't. \n\nI will say, double check what you're signing. Sometimes they don't ask the questions and just mark you down as a yes anyway. Also check your CC, especially if you prepaid thru a service like Expedia. \n\nAlso don't expect them to help in any way. The attitude I received and the words I was expressly told were that it was my problem to deal with. And dealing with them during the Christmas season as I was going home to put my father in the ground definitely made it my problem. But I made it theirs, too\n\nI will never use Hertz again.",
    "I visit this place frequently even without a vehicle and it being an hour away,  but I was quite disappointed when I discovered worms in my brussel sprouts.  I've never cooked the vegetable so imagine my disappointment when I was following a recipe that instructs you yo cut and peel.  Leaves had traces that something ate away partially at the outerlayers and I'm petrified to learn what's at the core.  I also am unable to get a refund because of my inability to drive out within 24 hours.  Im not pleased with having to waste money.   I hope they inspect their produce better or at least clear the voicemail so someone can voice a complaint without having to leave it here!",
    "Dropped my car off for a 4pm appt. came back at 7pm my car was still in the parking lot the way I left it. They didn't even bother to call to notify me they were running 3hrs late. The place only see you with an appt. so it's ironic they can't keep one.",
    "From the start, Marcia and CJ, have been immaculate!!  They were able to quickly assist me with my concerns and problems with my air-conditioning for my house. Marcia was sweet and caring with conversing with me over the phone to set up the appointment! Upon arrival CJ was extremely courteous, respectful, and very pleasant to work with. I HIGHLY... recommend this company to anybody and everybody if you have problems. CJ was very Delightful and courteous and respectful to my home and myself. Very knowledgeable and professional. CJ quickly solved my issues to make my home cool enough for a penguin to live. I'm grateful and appreciate The services that were provided.",
    "Downside everyone seems to be missing-- it's NOT ORGANIC. Why would I do a cleanse to detox myself with juice that has pesticides in it? Juice Nashville- become all organic!",
    "Very disappointed. Girls in the back are lazy. If it weren't for the girls in the back I could of walked out with my gun but they have a set time they stop running backgrounds which is fine but I have my CCW and they didn't want to do the work 30 minutes before closing because they are lazy. I suggest when gun shopping SNG on palo verde they will work pass the time to get you out with your gun!",
    "dont listen to elizabeth b.  this place is the greatest in philly.  if you need something done, holler at bobby schorr and they'll do you right.  'nuff said.",
    "Did not show up for our winery tour, with about 20 people planning on going.  No explanation, no call back.  Did not answer our calls.  AWFUL!  STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS!\n\nUpdate: Finally called back in the afternoon (about 4 hours after the scheduled trip) to offer a refund with no explanation or apology.  We'll see how that goes.  Again - STAY AWAY.",
    "My husband didn't get his work done that he was supposed to due to them canceling his appointment and them never calling us to let us know. I will never go back to this dentist ever now they are charging us for a stater plate that was never done they got paid by the insurance and still are charging us for something that was never done... and we can't contact them due to issues! But i give them 0 stars and will not recommend this place to anyone! They are scam artist and can't be trusted",
    "Sat night dinner for three, arrived at 7pm. I was told by Alexander the wait would only be 10-15 min.\nThe wait is only outside in the summer heat.\n45 min later, we were seated even though I kept tell him that tables were open. He mentions some nonsense about a supposed system the have. Useless.\nWe all had salads, mine was an uninspiring\nCesar with two crab cakes.\nOur waiter was too busy to offer a dinner roll until we were almost done.\nNot very happy with the\nMeal, the service and the wait in the heat!\nI, will not go back.",
    "The bartender, Kaydi, is really hot  and talented. Hard to come by these days! She pretty much runs the show there. Would definitely recommend anyone to stop by and hang out for a couple drinks.",
    "The service is terrible every time I come here. Servers are rude and slow and hardly check in or even make eye contact to get their attention.\n\nAlso food is so-so especially for the price. There's not much in the area for people but they should be kind of embarrassed to be so rude. Only come when friends come & wouldn't choose this on my own otherwise. Go to Conshochoken brewery (Bridgeport location)around the corner instead!",
    "Contacted this florist via YELP to ask if they were open for business during the covid pandemic. They are, and doing their best. Thank you!",
    "Fantastic!  I love and support REAL Butchers whenever possible as they are a dying breed and we NEED them.  Steaks?  (T-Bones for 9.99 per lb, Ribeyes for 13.99 perlb) Chicken?  Lamb?  Veal?  Sausages?  Even Dog Food (scraps??)!\n\nLove this place and can't wait to become more of a regular.",
    "I think this is worth the drive out of the city. They have tons of lanes, an arcade with air hockey and a bar/restaurant that is attached if you want food for your lanes.\n\nIt's about $5 a game, and you probably won't have to wait too long. They also have babysitting and you can go anytime (it's 24 hours). The post 3 a.m. crowd gets kinda' weird though.",
    "One of the owners is Blanca  She is so nice and always smiling and willing to answer your questions about her restaurant if you have some.  I had gone here for an event last Saturday, and I was excited to see a lady make tortillas outside.\n\n  I decided to try them out again today, and I had ordered what I always order a beans rice and cheese burrito.  It was sooo good I was very happy with my choice.\n\nPlus they have a drive thru so you don't have to get out of your car and order if you want something to go.",
    "I came in about 10 mins before they closed-- I wanted a pedi and mani... They told me to pick one... So I really need the mani...\nMani was good. They were nice enough... \n\nI didn't go back for the pedi... I went somewhere else. When I left there were about 5 people still getting their nails done... So they really could have done the pedi but I wont hold it against them as I did come in right before closing... Tampa shuts down EARLY.... Not use to that.",
    "Excessively overpriced.  I got a balayage and trim.  Cost me $190.  That's crazy.   I wish I would have known prior.  That's well over the going rate.  I won't be going back.  They should be more transparent with their prices.",
    "I really enjoyed the food and service. However I feel I was over charged for items I substituted. The $55 seafood bag turned in to a $89 seafood bag. I should have handled it at the time but didn't really notice the price difference until after so that's on me.",
    "Understaffed and no communication between staff members. I give them instructions on how to treat my pets and they completely ignore them. Very disorganized. If you love your pets do them a favor and take them somewhere that cares.",
    "I work in the area and didn't really know what to expect, given that the area doesn't have a ton of quality food options. However, I really have enjoyed any meal I have ever had here. The margherita pizza is among my favorites as well as the chicken cacciatore.\n\nCertainly worth a visit!",
    "DO NOT WORK for STATEMENT MODELS it is a scam, and I have never been paid. Please google before you work an event or take any tradeshow job, ladies. I've done everything I can to receive payment and will be filing a lawsuit.",
    "This place is very dirty to start with. I walked in with a cat I had found and she was pregnant. The said all that they do for strays is release them I said well I know you fix them ear tip them then release them and she said no we will turn around and let them go we don't have the money to do a TNR program. I waited 2 hours due to one staff make her who wanted to go take a 2 hour break. This place is a waist of time.",
    "My friend and I made appointments here for a pedicure on a friday afternoon in the summer- so it was obviously a little crowded. However, we signed in, picked our colors, and were taken back to the chairs pretty quickly. \n\nThe salon was clean, bright, and relaxing- it was pretty quiet but they also had signs up saying no yelling. The pedicure itself was good although I felt like they were trying to push up to get an upgraded pedicure and do a manicure as well. \n\nThey also have a rewards card system, but I believe you have to pay cash for it to count. I liked this place, but it is a little out of the way for me so I don't think it will become my go-to pedicure spot.",
    "Just ordered some Togo. Took about an hour wait. Got back to the house and and found my chicken jojo PASTA had no pasta. Just chicken and sauce. As well as my mash potatoes came with no gravy. No ranch for my fried mushrooms. And when I called to see what happen the waitress told me that she didn't know what to do and to call back tomorrow. \n\nPoorly ran establishment with no mangers and quality assurance.",
    "I called Fletcher's in order to get a Pax (run flat) tire repaired.  Immediately, I was told that type of tire was unrepairable.  I knew for a fact it was repairable.  I immediayely made my way to Chapman Honda and got it repaired without any problem.  Tire had a screw in it.  Don't think i'll be using Fletcher's any time soon.  It's obvious Fletcher's isn't fully familiar with the products they sell.",
    "I really wanted to like this place. But it's just too.... I dunno. Where to start... first of all, the space is far too small for the music. The music is good, but it's pumped so loudly through the speakers that you can't really speak to the person standing inches from you nor really enjoy the music itself. The layout kinda sucks, if you don't have a table or booth, are sitting at the bar, or on the dancefloor you're screwed. You're literally left standing in a 6\"x6\" space, being bumped into CONSTANTLY, in a bar that's way overcrowded and stupid hot. I'm glad there wasn't a cover because I probably would've been shittier. If I wanted that experience I'd go to a college town, not downtown Indy. That said, I'll def not be returning.",
    "This company is horrible.  They gave me a number for the claims representative.  It took almost an hour to get him to answer.  Then he said he needed a recorded statement from my son, we have spent over an hour calling the number every couple minutes, but nobody answers the phone!",
    "I got a notice stating my preorder was ready to be picked up from the store. When I got to the store, Jared tells me I cannot pick up the order because its not released yet. He was holding the movie in his hand but would not let me pick it up. I tried explaining that in the past, I have always been able to pick up my preorder when they were ready. Instead of trying to figure out a solution, he repeats that the item is not released yet and tells me to come back tomorrow. Why would you tell a customer the order would be ready to pick up if I clearly cannot? Thanks for wasting my time and gas, Best Buy.",
    "The receptionist is a guy who is a jerk. He is the son of Dr. West, and acts like he doesn't want to be there. His lack of customer service skills would best serve the clinic behind the scenes where he doesn't have to interact with people. I'm starting to understand why another vet clinic opened and took their name. DONT TAKE YOUR PET HERE!!",
    "I considered this the best KBBQ in Philly right now. The food, the service, and the atmosphere are great! \n\nSet A is more than enough for 2 people. The quality of meat is good, and I love the side dishes they offered. \n\nThe waiter was super nice and accommodating. They regularly checked on you and helped you grill the meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is very modern but still cozy. The restaurant is very new so I love how I did not smell like bbq food on me. \n\nI will definitely come back here again.",
    "Jen is theee best!\nJust came back from my very first Brazilian and she made the process so easy. She's lightning fast and I was done in ten minutes. I've heard lots of horror stories about waxing but Jen was so skilled, it hurt less than getting my eyebrows threaded.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",
    "I've been going here since I moved out here. I'll go every month or two and I've never had a issue. I usually just walk in and I'm usually helped within 15 minutes. I think there's only been once I waited awhile but I had nothing better to do so I didn't care lol\nI'm always pleased with the results :) I get acrylics which comes to $25",
    "I hate this place to death I would give them no stars if I could do not go here it is the worst they let my daughter finish a game but they would not let me go back",
    "Every time I have to call these people to discus my account I want to kill myself.  expect to be on hold for an hour at least if you ever have an issue.  In my case that is about once every three months.",
    "This is our Nissan dealer after Lou Fusz dropped Nissan. Not happy about this Saturday I tried there Express Service was told two hours for an oil change. I don't think so",
    "From their reviews it looks they are consistently awful, and I can vouch for that. Their phone support is par with their email support, non-existent.",
    "I've been calling all week to get my insulin. They say they haven't heard from the doctor. The doctor's office has confirmation from them that they got it a couple days ago. Now they're still saying it's the doctor's office they need info from.\nThankfully my doctor's office said I can come over Monday & they will get me a week's worth.\n\nAlso LDI charged $20 for 100 needles & I've been paying$3.50 for 200. I was told LDI doesn't shop around!!!",
    "I  have  used  George  and  his  crew  for  a few  jobs  and  all  I can  say  is  that  I was  more  than  pleased  with  the  service  as well  as  the  work. Great  people ."
