I wanted to like it, the person helping me said he gets what they send him and has no choice but to serve it. I tried to ask for a refund on my portion of the bill, they did something on the computer and showed me where they refunded my portion, we'll never happened.

Don't skip on the chuchvara either! These ground meat dumplings are the perfect fusion of East meets West.  Like beets? Make sure you grab the vinegret, they're pickled to perfection and also have some chickpeas as well. Make sure to get some Uzbek bread, and do not skip dessert! They have kunefe, a dessert made with shredded filo pastry, soaked in sugar syrup, layered with cheese and pistachios. This is something that's really hard to find, and I was delighted to find it at OSH. We have only gotten take out because of the pandemic, but that certainly hasn't messed with their flavors and their packaging is smart. It's really easy to just package up a dessert and not care if it goes soggy, but they took great care. We will be back...probably this week."

It was quiet and perfect for a lazy susan shared meal which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Fortunately a wine lover supplied us with good drink since we had forgotten about it being a BYOB.  Thank you David!\n\nWe decided to just order a lot of things with special longing for the hot pots, which some of my friends recommended.  The lamb hot pot was incredibly tasty and fresh. But really everything we order was excellent.  My one friend was set on something \"bright orangey\" colored in keeping with Chinese restaurant kitschy tradition and so Orange Chicken was ordered!  It was surprisingly good and meaty.  \n\nThis meal was a-typical for chinatown, in my opinion. It was a level higher in considering freshness and healthy fare.  It seemed less salty and more flavorful to me.  Im a new fan of Lee How Fook!"

They came out the next day (on time, actually a little early) and did a full system check. The service guy found that my system needed a pound of freon, but he couldn't pinpoint the leak. He let me know that it would probably turn into a bigger leak over the next year and explained the current changes to Puron and how I would want to start saving because it won't be cheap. While the news was sad, I appreciated that he was honest. Best part, my a/c is running great again and I only paid $30.

I love that you can buy reusable jars for soaps and shampoos. Don't feel like paying? They have free , albeit less attractive bottles for your use.

My husband and I took the Deuce Coupe and had my 5 year old daughter in back, and my friends Angela and Emily pedaled the Surrey with two 6 year olds in tow... \n\nIt was a hot day and provided quite the workout, but it was so much fun for all!  The bike route along the beach is incredibly scenic and easy to follow... \n\nWe were gone for less than two hours and the cost for the experience was just under $80 but the memory is priceless for all.

But for no reason should the ''run down'' feeling keep you away.

West Philly desperately needs a good brunch place, and God help me if the interior and location aren't both excellent (the intersection of 48th and Baltimore can feel positively Parisian at times).\n\nThat said, the prices are high and the food just isn't that great. It's mostly standard diner fare, delivered weekly by the Cisco truck, and the kitchen has a very tough time dealing with brunch rushes.\n\nAs a coffee shop, however, The Gold Standard fares pretty well. It's a lovely little spot to sit down and watch the world go by, and you can't go wrong with La Colombe coffee. So come in, linger with a cup, but go somewhere else for dinner."

I always head all the way down in the buffet and grab the chicken curry and the tandoori chicken. Naan is delicious, the little fried dough balls are AMAZING, and the soup has a nice, unique flavor. There are still a few things I need to try, but I was overall impressed by the food. \n\nThe service was impressively fast. My water glass was always full (and yo girl drinks a LOT of water), and they were very fast to take away plates. Perhaps even a little too overbearing on that, but I really appreciate the effort. Very happy with the few times I've been and will definitely be back! A must go."

The menu is limited.  \n\nAs a first timer, I decided to order all three of the different Kogi Bowls (Beef, Chicken and Spicy Pork).  For the price, you get a good sized portion in each bowl.  The rice, cabbage slaw and Mongolian grilled proteins portions were ample.  They were all enhanced with their Gochu Sauce which is a spicy mayonnaise.  \n\nAll three bowls were delicious however, my favorite was the Spicy Pork bowl.  It was tender and REALLY spicy.

From the moment you walk in a sense of relaxation and calm comes over you.  The staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  I was a little nervous about floating at first but the staff answered all my questions and put my mind at ease.  Floating is definitely a unique experience. I floated after my first half marathon and immediately felt relief.  My joints and feet which were very sore and swollen felt better instantly. I was so relaxed that towards the end of my session I fell asleep. I would definitely recommend floating and will be floating again very soon."

We went for lunch & were 100% satisfied by the food & the experience.  Kpicu is essentially Puerto Rican food that has been perfected.  I ordered the skirt steak with chimchurri sauce.  The steak came perfectly cooked & the sauce was outrageously fantastic.  It came with a portion of mufongo. I've had mufongo many times in many places, & have always liked it, but not loved it.  Well that changed with Kpicu's mufongo...I'm now in love, lol.  The dish also came with a helping of spiced slaw.  It was fantastic.  The flavors of each item were highly memorable.   The waiter was also very personable & kept checking on us.  \"Ya gotta check it out!\""

The texture was perfect.  Not too firm or mushy.  It had a larger dough to pork filling ratio (maybe about 2:1).  The pork, however, really provided a great flavor which made each bite tasty!!!  Great overall balance to the Boa! \n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup - Delicious!!  The beef was tender, the noodles added substance, and the broth was full of flavor.  The spiciness was great too! \n\nTianjin Style Crepe -  The only thing I would recommend would be a little more sauce to the dish.

Once you're seated, it's very cozy. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and everything on the menu sounds delicious. \n\nI've had their Cuban sandwich and the Pelopennese - both super tasty. \n\nThis is another of Tucson's gems.

I have the iron goat and it was a delicious, and slightly healthy twist to a lot of their dishes. The only reason for four stars is because the place was packed and it was kind of like cattle herding waiting for your food. Maybe it would be better if you took a number and someone brought the food to your table? Or even if someone stood at the door and paced the customers going to the counter so there wasn't a giant crowd gathered where the food comes out? Regardless I will definitely visit this place many more times in the future!"

Most dinner plates include gallo pinto (rice & beans), green plantain chips and repollo (coleslaw). \n\nThe only drawback is that the owner is also a waiter and the cook.

They were nice to my college-budget wallet :)\n\nEveryone here is so friendly & conversational! The environment is also really upbeat so you're never bored. \n\nDO plan on staying here a while. My hair took around 4 hours, more or less.

What was really disappointing is I ordered a steak medium and it was delivered almost rare.  I did return it, only to have it brought back (the same steak mind you) in the same condition.  A good restaurant will just make another one.  You can't refire a steak, it's ruined then.  Especially for a $50 steak??  I was shocked the chef would try and pull that one.  The rest of the meal was just ok.  Nothing was over the top good.  Needless to say I left hungry and not happy, but as I was told that evening, bless their hearts."

Not only that, he had a habit of not closing the gate afterwards (even though there was a gaping hole from where he pried off the planks, so he could easily lock the gate behind him), so my dog would escape the yard and we had to run around to find her.  We had to pay to get the gateway fixed. We were not amused.\n\nEdit: typo",

Meg, I miss you!  \n\nAll of my classes at Flourish were small and personal, which is so important for feeling relaxed.  The music, room temperature, and lighting were always so comforting, and the instructors are really great about allowing students to go at their own pace and offering help when needed/wanted.\n\nI'd highly recommend Flourish to anyone, whether you're new to yoga or have years of experience.

The Spicy Shrimp Arrabbiata was perfect with plump shrimp and italian sausage , sliced garlic,  red pepper and tomatoes tossed with penne pasta.  The sliced garlic takes on a different flavor compared to minced garlic and gave the dish nice twist.

This was done and cost me over 2000.00. I was shocked. Other attorneys quoted me that price for my entire divorce.  I was charged in multiple for everything. A phone call, email, and letter all saying the same thing. Charged for each one.  I showed my invoice to other attorneys and they were in shock at how much had been charged.  Perhaps for those with unlimited funds to put towards a divorce, this is the right law firm. But if you are on a budget consider them carefully.  Perhaps mine is the outlier of good service.

I went in for a gel manicure and let's just say Posh put my current nail salon TO SHAME!!!  Stephanie was my technician and she did an excellent job.  They put cuticle remover on then slip your hands in plastic baggies and heated mitts.  Who does that anymore?  Then when you go to wash your hands there is a scrub at the sink.  It's a nice touch!  You pick the scent for your lotion and they give you a nice massage with good pressure.  On top of all this my gel manicure looks perfect!  The color was applied thinly and evenly.  There are also tons of gel color options from different brands.  I'm looking forward to going back in a few weeks for a pedicure as well!"

It's a cute quaint shop that feels tucked away, we had walked and driven past so many times without noticing it even though it's right on Passyunk Ave. \nThe staff are super friendly and the interior is cozy and welcoming with British touches and paraphernalia scattered on the walls. We ordered the traditional beef and onion pie with mash (there are varying combos of pies, mash, and liquor). The first time we ordered it with liquor but it was too strong for my personal taste and I thought it overpowered the taste of the pie and mash so we nixed it the second time. It's some sort of parsley broth with vinegar. I love the sausage roll and we always finish that so quickly, I honestly could finish 2 of them in under a minute no problem. \nFor dessert we've only ever had the sticky toffee pudding and it is literally divine. It will change your life. The cake is so gooey and melt in your mouth and the cream sauce blends perfectly. You can't miss it if you come to Stargazy!"

I will never step foot in this bakery again, and I suggest that if you are an ethical vegan, you avoid it all costs.

Dr Pirok is very calming, and I love that they do a follow up call after every appointment. Also feel like the prices are reasonable and there's no nickle and diming. When my dog had tummy troubles, they didn't try to sell me medicine, and they also suggested to me a tooth cleaning for my dog rather than an extraction of 5-6 teeth like 2 other vets had suggested (and I was putting off b/c of cost and fear). I went for it and sounds like my dog doesn't need any extractions and probably never will unless he breaks a new tooth. The doctor called as soon as he was out of anesthesia (thank goodness because I was a nervous wreck) and he was great when I picked him up. I wonder if those other doctors would have cancelled the extraction (an $1800 price tag) once they discovered it wasn't really needed?"

They added a burger to the menu...a burger for God sakes!\n\nOn a Friday night, the place was maybe 1/4 filled. The restaurant used to be packed with a wait outside. Perhaps they changed the menu to salvage the business? I'm not sure...but there's little on the menu that really interests me any more. If I want a bowl, I'll just head down the street to Chipotle.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSomebody from the restaurant chose to reply below and all they did was get defensive and ENCOURAGE me to go dine at a different restaurant. Perhaps that's the reason for the slump in business? The menu has changed and although there's \"chile verde\" still, it only comes in the form of a burrito or what they call a bowl. You can't just get things as an entree anymore. The menu has cheapened, it feels more fast-foodish."

It was good sized, included fresh ingredients, and was fairly priced $9.99.  Simpler rolls start at $4.49.\n\nThe rolls themselves are along the lines of what you would get at SanSai... much better than your grocers pre-made sushi case, but not as good at a sit-down place like Wasabi down the street.

They offer both hot pot and Korean BBQ, which is awesome- why choose one when you can have both?  It's not cheap, but the ingredients are quality and it's unlimited, so you're guaranteed to leave stuffed.  Food for the grill is brought by your server, while hot pot options come by on a conveyer belt (but if you don't see what you're looking for, ask and somebody will bring it to you). They'll bring half portions as well, which is nice for trying smaller quantities of more things, or if you're getting full.  I think we've liked everything we've tried, but some favorites are the steak with house special sauce and the pork belly for BBQ, and the kimchi broth for the soup.  Servers are friendly. Drink options aren't plentiful but they have some good sake, and their house wine glasses are cheap and generous.\n\nCurrently, Nine Spices is closed for the COVID pandemic, but I'm writing this review anyway because they definitely deserve to make a comeback."

There are booths and a decent amount of seating at the bar.  The crowd was relatively eclectic, but overall it felt like a chill speakeasy style bar in Brooklyn or SoHo. The drinks are well thought out and deliver some fun for the palette.  I am curious about how they decided to organize the drink menu.  It's two sided (I missed the back side when I ordered my first drink!) and has an array of anchor liquors and many have an aperitif or a digestif but these seemed to be mixed haphazardly... but perhaps it's not random at all and there is actually some very simple(or genius) thing that I am missing.  \nI would definitely recommend this place!

The potstickers are the doughy-dumpling type filled with flavorful meat (it's often tasteless at other restaurants). I believe this same filling is in their dumpling soup--yum! The moo shu chicken is loaded with the same perfectly tender chicken and is exactly what I was craving.

The falafel sandwich is pretty filling and tasty and they are generous with the portions in all their dishes but the real winner is the fries, which is a mix of potatoes, onions and hot peppers.  The mix of those flavors is incredible!  I always make sure to get a large order of them, because they are just that good!  Be sure to get a seat in the back, as the ambience there is a lot of fun.  Prices are pretty reasonable and their food is always consistently delicious.  The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful as well.  In the summer, when I'm there with a crowd, we usually order a pitcher of their iced tea, which is very refreshing, with a hint of mint.  This is the one of the few places I'll eat when I'm in the South Street area."

Some people blamed it on Philly's hard water; others pointed to the inability of processed cheese to melt right; frankly, I didn't know what to believe...\n\nAnd then, I tried NYPD's pizza and the first bite of that cheesy slice brought me back to my childhood.  Thinking of Michelangelo (the turtle), I almost mumbled, \"Cowabunga\" in between rushed bites of pizza.  So, so good.\n\nNYPD Pizza has made pizza a weekly thing for me.  As Hayley Sara B says, it definitely holds up during delivery; plus, their delivery guys are so friendly and polite.

And I'm sure the kids would love to see this one!\"  And I'm sure my kids (Jude and Lucy) would have loved to see anything besides the video screens in the back. \n\nI am so disappointed in the show last night. We paid $124.50 for general admission tickets, but were duped. With GA we knew we would be standing BUT they didn't let you stand anywhere near the band playing. Lots of empty space and folding chairs (VIP?) up front and we weren't allowed within 60 feet of the stage. The back corner by the smoking doors became \"the children's section\".  That's cool, NOT!  At least all the kids had fun playing paper airplane and watching TV with the other kids there :(\n\nFrom a parents point of view."

I don't even know what all was in this but it was a big plate of deliciousness. The cheese sauce and the hash-brown-like cake of potatoes underneath all the meat were both sooooooo good.\n\nI had the chilaquiles - 4/5. They were pretty tasty. The salsa verde wasn't the best I have had but I could see ordering this again since it's such a scarce dish around here. The potatoes on the side were tasty too!\n\nMy mom had the standard eggs benedict - 3/5. It was just okay. The hollandaise sauce was bland and there wasn't much of it.\n\nSo, a 5, a 4, and a 3 average out to a 4 overall. Good place, a little pricy for breakfast though."

Now, that's something special."

I was also surprised how big it was inside - I'm not saying don't make reservations on busy times, but they do seat a lot.  Again, check them out, especially if sushi is your thing."

Had to go to this moron for wound check. Everything was O.K. Except she left a wire in me, which she nonchalantly mentioned.

They found a great used car for me in the price range I was looking for a few years ago.  Recently I returned to test drive a couple cars.  It turned out that I didn't buy from them a second time but it was because I ended up buying a new car.  Another bonus of this place is that they have mechanics on site.  So most of their cars come with service options for yearly inspection and routine maintenance."

Not my bag, baby.  BUT, since I was already in there (alone with two employees) and loathe awkward situations, I got the $4 chocolate chip cupcake anyway.  First, I don't expect \"gourmet\" cupcakes to be cheap, but $4 is WICKED (yes, I am from Mass. and that is the only appropriate word here) EXPENSIVE unless it's jumbo.  The two stars are basically for the friendly employees and the free cupcake they gave me...the one with a candy bar on it...the chocolate cake was moist.  The chocolate chip cake was dry, though.  I had half of each and even though I paid money, I'm not even sure I want to finish the rest off.  If whipped cream-type frosting is your thing, you might like this better.  I doubt I'll be back, though."

My waitress, Cassandra, was very friendly and attentive, and quickly took my order of Charvida Salmon and a glass of the Robert Mondavi Chardonnay.\n\nMy order quickly came out no more than 10/15 minutes after. The salmon was generously sized and was served with a side of slaw. The salmon itself was good--nothing earth shattering, but it was a solid salmon. The slaw complemented the salmon well-- adding a different flavor and texture.

I have been several times as I live close by. A couple times ago, my husband and I started our meal with the Cheesy Caprese Bread, oh my gosh! So good, highly recommend this appetizer. It was like a cheesy bread but with caprese flavors (exactly as advertised). For the slice, I highly recommend the The Clayton, it has some very unique flavors with the coconut curry base and smoked chicken. My second favorite would be Story Book, I love the pesto flavors. There is a deal that will save you a couple bucks when buying the slice and beer together. PRO TIP: One slice is enough! They are quite large. The restaurant is big and is a popular place for watching games, if there is a big sporting event happening you will want to get there early. They also have a nice back patio area."

One floor plays house/electro and another floor plays hip-hop/top 40s. Love that!\n\nSo despite the, I guess you can call it, 'glowing' review I just gave of Rumor, there is a caveat!  Expect to pay a hefty cover. And, no even if you're a girl, expect to pay a cover. I really don't understand why clubs in Philly charge cover even to girls but it seems like they all do-- and well, Rumor is probably the most stringent/expensive one of them all. Unless you become buddies with one of the securities, you'll probably end up paying somewhere around $20. \n\nNonetheless, I have fun here! Good DJs, big dance floor, fun times."

If you want a downtown park with a playground better suited for older children, I'd recommend Ann Morrison Park instead. \n\nJulia Davis is spread out enough that it's a great place to observe nature like ducks, geese and chipmunks without too many noisy children to scare them off.  We saw a lot of geese and fluffy goslings today in particular.  Feeding water fowl is discouraged to prevent them from becoming dependent on people, but not everybody complies.  I'd avoid eating at the picnic tables near the lagoon and stick to more populated areas if you don't want company.\n\nBare in mind that an abundance of water fowl also means an abundance of water fowl droppings so check your shoes and stroller wheels before packing up to go."

The chips with salsa and queso are a great snack, and the long tots with longhots and cheese are completely delicious.  \n\nBest of all were the vibes -\u00a0kind of island-y, plus a super amazing playlist that was later replaced by a DJ who was fantastic. I also loved the local artwork, which became a topic of discussion between almost everyone seated at the bar at one point. We called it a night around 10:30 but I could have partied all night in that atmosphere. Can't wait to return (and I don't even love bowling)!"

The cheese & mushroom pierogis were particularly tasty and the kielbasa was much tangier than grocery-store versions.  They also offered some unusual Polish wines, sweet fruit or honey choices. To take home, they have a small grocery area with Polish/German/Russian special foods,  non-perishable, fresh deli, and some frozen peirogis etc.\n\nUntil Tampa gets a better Polish place or cheap flights are offered to Warsaw or Krakow, this is our go-to pace for an authentic taste of the land of sainted JPII."

The place is clean and stylish but definitely screams chain. The wait staff is very nice and attentive.\n\nNow the not so good. The family style salad we had was certainly a decent quantity, but I expect a lot more for $9 than a bunch of chopped romaine, a few slices of tomato and egg and about 6 olives and ten chick-peas. Really? Add to that the fact that they only offer two salad dressings: red wine vinegarette and oil and vinegar. Skip the salad (there was only one other salad choice and that didn't have lettuce).\n\nThe pizza we had (tomato and mozzarella with red sauce) was a total disappointment. Brick over doesn't mean scorched end crust (like they needed a fire extinguisher scorched). The tomatoes tasted as if they had been frozen and the mozzarella low grade. The pizza also lacked any seasoning (but so did the salad).\n\nWe won't be back"

Greasy substance was sprayed on stainless appliances to clean, which worked well, but substance was left on kitchen floor afterwards and tracked through home. Over half the time spent cleaning the home was on vacuuming the upstairs loft and 2 bedrooms, which see very little traffic and weren't dirty. Bathrooms were left dirty. Contacted owner regarding the poor cleaning and was told that sometimes homes are so dirty they need a deep cleaning- fell for that, spending $400, and house wasn't any cleaner after the deep clean . Total waste of time and $600 for both services. I strongly recommend you hire a company that actually DOES what they advertise."

I recently had a two level lumbar fusion performed by Dr. Puya Alikhani.  This guy is great!  He explained the procedure thoroughly, telling me what to expect and what not to expect.  My recovery was amazingly pain free.  Dr. Alikhani was able to inject a long lasting anesthetic (not available at Tampa General so I went to Advent) that gave me an almost pain free hospital stay.  He visited me the afternoon after surgery and found me sitting up in a chair with my legs crossed.  I'm one month post surgery and feel great.

We walked around looking for who was open for breakfast. Gaspar's Grotto was open and happily ready to seat us. We sat inside at the front right window for greT people watching. The server quickly brought us our drinks and took our orders: Cuban French toast with bacon and hash browns, Cuban breakfast sandwich with hash browns, breakfast skillet, and Cuban toast with hash browns. The food took a little bit but I was also very hungry and so was the rest of the family. Once the food arrived, we were extremely happy with our choices and worth the wait. The food was delicious. The breakfast sandwich and Cuban French toast had such big portion sizes that we brought have of it back home. It made for a nice family breakfast outing in Ybor."

The chef's work was incredible.  I am a relatively picky eater, so when a saw a menu with bone marrow, ceviche, cherry and goat cheese grits, octopus, and cranberry bleu cheese creme brulee, I was a little worried.  But when I approached each dish with an open mind, I was truly stunned by the quality of the craftsmanship and the beer complements of each dish. Every one of them was excellent.\n\nAfterwards (as if we hadn't had enough beer) we went to the bar on the first floor.

The tab she ran my card for was not mine and was for well over $80. Our combined bill was maybe $30. I asked for a manager and she said that there wasn't one there that night and handed me a bunch of cash from the tip jar. She was rude, unhelpful, and definitely is up to something shady with people's tabs. \n\nThis place is poorly run and will rip you off.",

I got it delivered to the dorms and I have to say they were incredibly fast and the food was really good.  The pizza was of higher quality without a huge price tag which you have to love about pizza.  I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza it had nice fresh pieces of chicken with a tangy bbq sauce and 2 types of cheeses making it oh so dam tasty.  They delivered pretty late for a pizza place that's not some brand name crappy pizza place.  Just saying, a large is more then enough for 3 people to share but so good you may not want to share it.  I will order from here again not just because they are convenient but also because they are incredibly taste and cheap.  Come check this out you will be amazed."

Today our office lunch was a taco bar catered by Fig Tree.  \nThey did not bring chaffing dishes or any such thing to keep the meat, rice, and beans hot or the sides (salsa, sour cream, cheese) cold.  Ok, that we could get past.  Bland chicken we could not.  Everyone had the same opinion on the sides - the salsa and beans came straight of their bulk containers (I'm pretty darn sure that's the flavor of the salsa you purchase by the gallon from Costco).  They also brought brownies that tasted like they were straight from a box mix.  It's only an office lunch so we aren't expecting fine dining but we ARE expecting to have food that isn't just heat and serve.\nAll in all it felt like something I could have done myself for much less and made far tastier.\nWe pay 12.50 a head for catered lunches.  This budget has allowed us to order from many super tasty places, both chain and local.  If they are able to make a profit and provide good food then why can't Fig Tree?"

But they are generous with the amount of fish that is in the roll. It pleasantly was surprising. And it tasted good too!! Of course I also had to order the mango sticky rice... And yes it was a little different than others I've tried... But it was still very good. Also they give you a generous amount of mango!! Much appreciated! I love mango.

Maybe it's the consistent mediocrity or the yelpworthy matzoh ball soup, but either way, whenever I'm there, my expectations wither and indecisiveness swells. Their robust menu always makes my head spin, but I can't complain - the ability to order breakfast all day makes eggs benedict a reasonable option at 10pm. Now that's something.\n\nMy roommate's a fan of the chocolate chip/cookie dough pancakes; something she often substitutes for her otherwise ice cream laden dinner. They also offer \"control freak\" salads - an idea that I think must have stemmed from their West Philly location after all the food-scared Penn girls requested modified meals. I once overheard a fellow student request mustard as her dressing. Ick. \n\nI have to say though, it's pretty great having that \"if all else fails\" option, and I give them props for offering such a smorgasbord. Don't expect the best rendition of your favorite meal, but hey, at least it's there when you can't think of anywhere else."

One of the best things about Mexican food is how affordable it is. If you're going to charge more, you better be making something special that sets you apart. While your steak with verde salsa dish ($13) was delicious, canned refried beans and bland rice do not justify the cost.\n\n-2 stars: Terrible service. Not friendly, not attentive, and apparently not fond of giving refills or delivering the check less than 10 minutes after the meal is finished. There were at least 4 servers working and only about 10 tables filled in the whole restaurant, so I don't think I'm being unreasonable with my expectation of something resembling courtesy.\n\nBUT I'll give one on those stars back for having above average salsa and a diverse menu including more traditional dishes.\n\nWould I go back? Maybe, but probably only for lunch."

The layout kinda sucks, if you don't have a table or booth, are sitting at the bar, or on the dancefloor you're screwed. You're literally left standing in a 6\"x6\" space, being bumped into CONSTANTLY, in a bar that's way overcrowded and stupid hot.

You can note this on the sign-in sheet.\n\nAfter giving the stylist your trimming preferences, he/she will use a machine to massage your shoulders and upper back areas. Hot towels are also utilized, and highly appreciated. Afterwards, you'll be asked if you would like a shampoo. Prices are quite reasonable at this location.\n\nParking can be a bit challenging.

I showed up with no reservation and was still seated 3 minutes after on a Saturday night and it was packed , that was awesome. Our server was so helpful she was very attentive and was kind enough to go through most of the menu with us and gave us some great choices. We started with a Thai mule and thai msrgarita both with fresh basil but the mule had a house infused ginger vodka that set apart from many mules I've tried. As for the food wow, I love curry and they have such great tasting curry with so much flavor and just the right amount of spice. I had a vegan white curry with perfectly seared veggies and the curry had a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. My lady had the salmon in a red curry sauce. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce was also superb and she got the level 2. Great overall service , food and drinks really good spot and is one of Tucson best already in my mind."

I vey seldom have difficulty finding what I need, and if I do, staff is always helpful for those of us who can be locationally challenged. \n\nWhat else is there to say - they carry decent products at a decent price (both store and name brand), it is open and does not feel cramped and crowded, shelves are usually kept in order without random items strewn about, and the check-out people are very cordial.\n\nI will continue to support them because of their inclusive corporate policies both for their employees and their customers."

If you're looking for a fun spot to meet up with friends for brunch, The Shack is a perfect spot. \n\nBut ultimately, I choose to judge a restaurant by its food, and The Shack fell a little short in this department. The food sounds amazing on the menu, but in reality comes out mediocre. It's not bad, but just doesn't quite live up to the menu descriptions. I can't quite put my finger on it - maybe the food was a little too salty or greasy or bland, but there was something off. \n\nOverall though, the experience is still enjoyable, so I wouldn't mind returning with friends."

There are two separate accounts (Digestive Health Associates & Digestive Health Center).  While we waited for our insurance payments to be applied correctly, Associates sent us monthly statements for full amount. We paid $100 a month to keep us current, but they still sent us collection notices with comments that we may never be able to use their services again (just horrible customer service!). I had to keep my own precise Excel log of every invoice and payments applied because there's was so bad. I noticed they didn't apply one of our $100 payments, so had to notify them to apply it.  Our insurance has now paid and it turns out we have overpaid and they owe us a refund. I called their billing department and it is a call center in India.  The call center is confused about our statement and all they could say is they will look into it.  It may be a year until I get this sorted out!!  Just horrible..."

The process was completely pain-free beginning with the Novocaine injection and including the extraction itself and post-surgery healing.

Where else can you buy a bong, imported ice cream from mexico, and a custom sandwich in one transaction? That sentence alone should draw anyone in. \n\nPlus this place is dirt cheap. A ton of food for less than six bucks (usually). One platter from this place can feed me for 5 days! And it's sooo good. I've been making my way around the menu and I haven't found something I didn't like yet. \n\nParking lot is basically a giant pothole and tricky as hell to maneuver through.

It was a good slice, just not my thing. I'd like to try some of the other menu options. I thought the bottom was a tiny bit too burnt but I am very sensitive to that sort of thing. \n\nGood service.

The soup of the day looked refreshing! I ordered the watermelon gazpacho, topped with goat cheese and mint and also their house salad with apples, walnuts, and blue cheese. I was uber stoked. \n\nInside the restaurant was pretty small, so luckily I scored one of the two tables outside. It's off a side street, but it still allowed some much-needed people watching. The soup and salad was the perfect combination for lunch. Soup was chilled, and the mint added a nice coolness for which I savored.

While in the office he checked to see if my permanent crown had come in with the recent delivery.

My child got sick within the first couple weeks and she literally gets a cold once a year so it had to be something nasty. Main reason we wanted our child there is because shes already more advance than some  from just learning at home. We definitely chose the school because of the \"high\" credentials also to be social with other kids. My child understand why some of the kids were mean for no reason and were agressive. Teachers seem to avoid talking to you. Seems like the kids don't have to listen or follow the curriculum and do watever they want. The staff atmosphere is similar to zombies. I'm sure there are better schools out there. All these people care about is the tuition check."

It's grown up nicely into a one million sq ft modern airport that serves as a hub for Southwest Airlines.  You can pack a lot into that kind of space, four concourses, wonderful restaurant and shopping options, fresh carpet, device-chargers under the lobby seats, and four runways to serve most of the bigger jets.\n\nNashville is clearly blooming, a great city, exploding food scene, amazing live music on every street corner and 7-11 (not really-but I did see an artist performing in a Kinko's).\n\nOne of the first impressions of a city is through it's airport and BNA is AOK."

It's a blend of white rice mixed with black rice, which has more health benefits than regular rice. \n\nThe space itself is cool and I love how the booths are curved at the top and futuristic looking. They are doing a great job with social distancing and the staff seems to be super sharp. My only suggestion would be to have a few set bowls on the menu for people who aren't good at putting individual ingredients together.

Lesson learned."

                "I really used to like this place until yesterday when the bartender inside randomly took it upon herself to take her 20% tip out of my husband's cash payment.  I've been here quite a few times with friends and have never had this happen, this time it was just me and the Hubz and this happened. VERY TACKY.  I guess the bartender assumed that we would not tip 20% on our own, so she decided to \"help us out\" with it.  We will not be returning to this establishment but will instead, spend our money elsewhere."

None of that bad old fish smell that tells you to run.  This had a wonderful grill smell.  The next problem I found when I set down was determining what to order.  Should I order the tacos, a fajita plate, or something less common?  I was stuck, so I asked my server what she would suggest.\n\nI don't remember the specific name, but it was a great shrimp dish with a delicious green sauce (I'll include picture below).  While there was lots to eat, I cleaned my plate.  I will be going back.\n\nThe decor is not fancy, but smartly done and inviting like visiting your aunt/uncles house for a fiesta.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.\n\nI ended up getting a flan to take home because I was so full.  It was as amazing as the meal."

I also ordered the Wing Dings (whole chicken wings) with Our Houz sauce.  The Our Houz sauce is highly recommended and is easily my favorite.  The Q'z Houz Lemonade is served in a mason jar which you get to keep as a souvenir.  The server was excellent, attentive and made sure everyone there received the best service possible.

On any given day you might discover anything from a ramen burger to deep-fried lasagna burger, or a peanut-butter-and-jelly burger to a Hot Pocket burger. PYT's star player, though, is definitely the Krispy Kreme slider platter! Beef and chocolate-covered bacon piled onto toasted, sliced Krispy Kreme doughnuts. Mmm! There's nothing else quite like it.\n\nThe Bad: Execution is hit-or-miss. The beef itself is excellent, but the toppings and sauces sometimes aren't quite flavorful enough. Fried chicken sandwiches are average, and PYT party fries are your run-of-the-mill loaded fries with bacon, cheese, and onions -- tasty, but otherwise unremarkable. Service was particularly slow, considering we were one of only two groups in the whole establishment.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, give PYT a shot -- it's only a SEPTA ride away from Penn."

If you have had a Sonoran Dog anywhere in town, whether a brick and mortar restaurant or a food truck, you have probably had their buns. Alejandro's is everywhere. So you should go to the source of the \"everywhere\" and try them out.\n\nI occasionally like to make my own Sonoran Dogs so I go to the source that everyone else does: Alejandro's Tortilla Factory. I get a bag of their buns, usually a bag or two of their tortillas (which I find to be among the best I've ever tasted), and in their smallish grocery section, get a can of pinto beans for the Sonoran Dogs as well as their salsa fresca. I even got a donut there. It was very good!\n\nI haven't tried their in-house cafe yet. It looks tempting. Prices are right and the menu looks good.\n\nService is friendly.

The Burger was way above average. It was a little overcooked to my taste but it could've been the way I ordered it. I wanted pink so I ordered it medium but really got it medium well. So if you want it pink order it more like medium rare. The bun was above average as well although a little bit tough. A  A little bit softer would've been nice.

I expected it to be an overpriced record store and was delightfully surprised that everything from the trinkets, t-shirts to the vinyl was reasonably marked. This is a great place for Third Man Records artist items and just a great place to put on your tour of Nashville list. The performing monkey machine is pretty cool along with the old recording booth. They also have live events at TMR.\n\nAlso, if you ever get to see Jack White in concert--he is worth every cent! I saw him perform in Nashville with special guest Loretta Lynn and it was the best concert that I have ever been to by far."

They wanted 3 things: 2 brand new items and 1 dress in really good shape. The Anthropologie jumpsuit still had tags on it for $150; they wanted to offer me $9-10. Are you serious? That's not even 10%. The girl explained they would only resell it for about $22 which I think wasn't accurate. I saw almost nothing in the store for that price, especially NWT and especially from Anthropologie. The used sweaters they were selling from there were $20. Oh and the boots that were basically new without tags and Laundry by Shelli Segal dress they bought? I got $8 and some change for them.\n\nThe girl who sorted my clothing was nice enough but for the prices they offer for brand new and like new, I'd rather sell them online than waste the gas to sell anything here!"

On one of the snowiest nights of the year thus far, one of my nose pads decided to jump ship. \n\nIt's not easy driving around in low visibility with one part of your glasses gouging out the side of your nose. Rather than live in discomfort all the way home, I searched for who was close by (and open around 6:30pm) using Yelp and found this location. \n\nBecause of the snow, I was the only person in the store. Not only did they replace one nose pad, but they replaced both because I suppose they could tell the other one was ready to fall off too. Fast, excellent, thorough, friendly service with a smile. The nose pad replacements were free, as in many vision centers, but I felt like it was necessary to pay it forward with this review! If I lived in the area and was in the market for an optometrist, I would definitely give Pearle Vision a try!"

I've celebrated several occasions here with groups big & small, and I can't thank Giorgio enough for putting up with our drunken shenanigans. \n7. Finally, the price point is totally reasonable and the portions are generous. These 7 reasons make Giorgios a no-brainer."

She put everything together and I gained a clear path of action. I highly recommend going to see Reina for a reading. She will take her time with you and tell it how it is. The best way to reach her is through the phone number on this page."

That said, Iyengar yoga is a very different style of yoga and may not appeal to those who like more active styles or flow routines. At 12 South, you hold poses for longer and focus on form rather than speeding through a series. This is great for people who either already have or are prone to injury, since props can be used to achieve the full pose. But don't be fooled by the slower pace; this is definitely a workout. \n\nThe lower level classes do not emphasize the breathing or chanting that is often associated with yoga, so if that is something that you dislike, this is the place to try.\n\nInstructors are attentive, classes are generally small and the facility is terrific -- very clean, with quality props, easy parking and a small selection of yoga apparel and accessories for purchase. \n\nI need to sign up for another session. :)"

Both were crunchy and packed with flavor. The fries are crispy and delicious.\n\nThe only negative is that both the wings and fries came out a bit cold which for the Korean BBQ made the sauce thick and for the Parmesan the cheese didn't melt all the way.

Do yourself another favor, when they ask if you want gravy for your mashed Potatoes, SAY YES! \nIf you order fried chicken here , you are informed that it will take 25 minutes because it's pan fried , FRESH. So sit back, relax, order a drink (they serve Beer & Wine) and be patient .. It's worth the wait!"

We called the dealership back to see if they had a 30 day warranty, but instead they were rude and hung up on us.\n\nI would not trust purchasing another car here, as they don't care if it works well or not.  They sell cars as-is.  Unless you are a mechanic or have the car totally inspected, Be safe and don't purchase.  Had my husband not checked the calipers, my daughter, her husband and 2 kids could have been killed had they stepped on the brakes suddenly.  Don't come to this place to buy a car....they sell crap."

I've tried a couple that weren't my favorites, but a few that I return for frequently.\n\nI personally also really like their bowls (grain, etc), but the salads - to me - are what make this place great! Their app also makes it super easy to order ahead and just walk in to pickup! I'd highly recommend trying Chopt if you're a salad person.

We had to pay to get the gateway fixed. We were not amused.\n\nEdit: typo",

What I can review on that is consistent across the board is this company's customer service.  From start to finish you know exactly what is going on, you are informed every step of the way. Any questions that I had even if they would stray from the issue, there was always someone that could answer and help and go out of their way to get help . The kindness from everyone I have worked with exceeded all expectations. I will continue to recommend them to family and friends, even if they cannot personally take on a case for you they will find someone who can."

We ate on the patio which was quiet and delightful!  \n\nI had a \"greuben\" sandwich, which featured a really huge grouper fillet that was breaded and fried.   The fish was flaky and delicious, and the way it extended so far past the marble rye bread made me think of a tenderloin.   I'm not sure the sandwich reminded me much of a reuben, but it was a tasty fish sandwich!  The sweet potato fries were fine; nothing too exciting, standard likely frozen waffle cut, but good!  My friend had a Cobb salad with shrimp; she really enjoyed it and it did look very good!  \n\nThe beer selection is great!  I had an Indian Brown Ale which was something I hadn't seen before, so had to try it!  It reminded me a bit of a porter and I enjoyed it!\n\nSadly, they had no desserts.

The fries were perfectly seasoned, the chicken was juicy, the hummus was fresh, the pita was warm. My boyfriend loved his as well & even asked for more pita- which was no problem at all. I ordered the side of \"hot sauce\" which was great to dip everything in, especially if you like your food with a kick. \n\nI was absolutely full, but we still decided to order a desert. I cannot remember the name of what we got (it wasn't the baklava, it had oranges on top) but it was AMAZING. I literally had to force myself to eat more because there was no way we weren't going to finish it.\nI recommend Kanella Grill for a delicious, casual, Mediterranean meal you won't regret.\nRemember its BYOB, so grab some drinks & bring them with you!"

It was a little hard to keep up because it wasn't in English; overall a very interesting cultural experience. :)"

I have never had Hot Pot before, and had no idea what to expect. \n\nWe ordered the Green Glam Broth for our Seafood combination, and the Tube Bone Broth for our Pork Combination. We decided to go wth the combinations instead of the al-la-carte options, mainly because we were rookies.  The green clam broth was a my favorite, and I would order it again in a heartbeat. It was salty, light, and perfect.  I was super impressed with the Seafood combination. It came with crab, shrimp, squid, mussels, noodles, and a ton of clams. \n\nAfter drinks, 2 large meals, and an appetizer, we left spending less than $50... which I consider great for a date night."

My car was dirty, they didn't even try to clean up after themselves, both inside and out. But what really pissed me off was that my driver's side seat was broken. When I confronted the guy, he claimed zero responsibility and said they would only pay half. It was only until after I threatened legal litigation they agreed to pay to fix it. And they still didn't clean it. (I ended up detailing for 3 hours). They weren't nice, they didn't offer me any discount or deal, and they sure didn't consider that my family had bought 3 vehicles from them in the past. I wouldn't even trust them to install wiper blades, no thanks, I'll do my own service from now on."

All the flavor in the mac n' cheese came from the bread crumbs on top--so I ate about 10 bites. The pasta was also a little overcooked. The sauce, which they say has white cheddar and parmesan, did not have the sharpness I would expect from those two cheese.

She was very informative and knowledgeable regarding every aspect of her practice. You can tell she cares very much about what she does as well as her patients. \n\nWe are new to the area, but I will recommend Karen to anyone who is looking for a holistic approach to medicine.

Checking in and going through the process of what to do and expect was easy. Chaz and his staff are welcoming and knowledgeable. The healing room where the float tank is, is clean, inviting and very relaxing. During my float I experience everything from giddy giggling, to deeply calm serenity. The time flew by as I grew more relaxed and just allowed myself to float and be present. After my float, I felt lighter and brighter - as though my entire body had received a reset, physically and emotionally.  I have never been \"good at\" meditation, or anything that required me to be still and relax for a period of time and quiet my mind, but this was easy and the benefits have lasted for days. I've slept better and have felt so peaceful since my float. I'll be coming back for another one very soon."

I was prescribed a menagerie of medications and she worked with me to get me the best pricing. When I asked for moisturizer and sunscreen options, she has handouts with pictures of recommend products with pictures--so helpful. When I asked for advice she wrote it down and gave me options for good information. She went over the side effects of my long-term antibiotics and helped with managing the co-occurrences. The aesthetics of this place are great. Really swanky, feels like a spa. They sell products here but aren't pushy about them at all. The receptionists are friendly and give great directions. The nurse/assistant who first dialogues with me saw kind as well. I'm happy and confident to be treated here."

It is a charming setting along the banks of the canal, and with the Boat House right nearby for a cocktail, very inviting in atmosphere.  Food was plain and not memorable, fish overcooked, and the dessert we shared was so dry (it was an olive-oil cake, yes they are supposed to be dry but this was inedible) we threw out the portion we took home.
