The owner is a good man, treats people fair, as a matter fact I once drop my wallet called an hour later, he found it and waited 30 minutes past closing for me to get back and pick it up! However, recently he seem to have hired a bunch of retards who can't understand the concept of service. But then again, it's $10 bucks & location is prime. I'll go back there, but only in a pinch!",

We wished we would've gotta a full sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious! We both ordered a sopa  chicken and carne asada. The sopas were as big as the plate it came out on.

It is family friendly, and children enjoy it.  The building is really cool - and sharks are always fascinating,  You can touch a ray, have fish, sharks and rays swim over your head in the tunnels, and also feed the rays - but be mindful of feeding times.  Costumed staff/tour guides add to the charm factor.  The gift shop has a nice assortment of souvenirs. ",

You can walk through a tunnel and they swim right over you. We were taking shark selfies!  They have a really nice touch tank and an amazing jellyfish display.   It's a very relaxing place.  The staff are knowledgable (ask about the poor turtles).   We had a great time today. Even our 8 month old liked it.",

Now there are lounge chairs in the petting area. \n\nIt's a small place. I walked through the entire thing in an hour and I probably read like 10 info plates.\n\nIt will be great in a few years, with the expansions.",

The roll is huge, it's stuffed with lots of vegetables. The eggplant bacon inside the roll is flavourful and so is the nut pate. The roll is served with a fresh salad on the side. Which makes a satisfying and filling meal. Raw food are usually made with a lot of nuts but some dishes on their menu can be requested nut free. ",

Service was super disappointing and no apology was even given after having to have waited so long to get served for takeout. It almost felt as the priority there was given to the staff socializing amongst each other instead of putting customers first. On another note after having waited this long my smoothie was watered down and bitter...I was in a rush so I just left. Other than this the food is always great at your other locations but the attitude needs to be worked on at this specific location."

I've had the item at a few places, and my point of reference is Yoshi Burrito, the first place at which I had the dish. That is, for me, a four out of five star place. This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi. It's not a bad place, and if you're in the area, you certainly can do much worse, but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to get there."

A little more expensive than your average pizza joint but definitely worth it.

I made the mistake of getting a small since I had eaten before, but definitely won't make that mistake again! Make the most custom pizzas and layer that bad boy up with toppings and free sauce...

            "review_4": " Stopped here yesterday and got take-out. I've eaten at their other location several times and it has seemed like the food has slightly changed over time. Not for the better. I was very disappointed to see a man throw a bag of gray gyro meat chunks on the grill as I walked in. So I guess they don't slice the meat fresh off a spit. My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared. Their hummus was still good but could use a little more garlic or something.  I'll be taking a lengthy break from Pita Cafe. ",

Just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over.\n\nThis is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food.\n\nI liked this place and for $5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza.\n\nWill definitely be back again and try other items from the menu.",
            "review_7": " Just as awesome as the other location.  I love that this is a family run business.  This location is super clean, and I love that they have so many places to sit.  The food is always top notch, fresh and comes out fast. ",

Our group shared the appetizer with cheese and cured meats. I ordered ravioli, so delicious!! I couldn't stop talking about it for days. The portions are on the smaller side, compared to other Italian restaurants, yet even still, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction and a desire to order other dishes ( appetizer, and dessert). \n\nService was excellent , even during a busy  Friday night. \n\nDefinitely will come here again and bring my friends to try it!

Food is consistently good quality and well priced though not particularly exciting.  The dining room size is perfect for keeping the space well occupied, creating enough buzz but not feeling cramped.  Staff are usually knowledgeable and well mannered.

I do not recommend this place at all",

They wouldn't even let me browse the parking lot until I came in, and listened to a pushy rundown. I am a middle aged woman, and have never been treated so poorly at a business before. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews prior to wasting my time. Please save yourself the trouble, and go to a different Nissan dealership. ",

He kept us well informed on the options available to us, explained exactly what the cost would be for each repair, returned calls promptly, and even took steps to help us get a better price. The mechanics were also great to work with. They explained clearly their rationale, took us back to see the problems ourselves, and never tried to sell us on something we didn't need. The whole team was excellent to work with and we highly recommend them! ",

Peoria Nissan and John in particular went out of there way to accommodate my wife and I on a potential purchase of a new Nissan Juke. He is extremely knowledgeable of the product and he consistently offered solutions to getting a deal done. In this industry I consider John the gold standard. I will refer John and Peoria Nissan to any potential friends/relatives that are looking for a vehicle. Give John a try I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",

I called him the next day to tell him how much I appreciated him expediting everything and he asked how my daughter was.  He was genuine and I appreciated that he cared.

Lousy experience and will be looking elsewhere for Indian.",

            "review_3": "Amazing food. Being Indian I can say it's authentic.  The new dessert mango kulfi is out of this world.  The owners go out of there way to accommodate special food restrictions like food without onion and garlic.  Will come again.",

It's a small, quaint comfortable place with benches and seat cushions (plus regular chairs).  We had 2 martinis- I thought the mango lassi martini was a great idea and tasty!

I was not very impressed with it.  They were only 3 medium size pig feet in the soup, so it was not very filling.  I think the beef noodle soup would've been more filling.  But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.  The turn over rate is pretty fast, so even if there is a line, i wouldn't think the wait would be too long.   If you are sick of buffets on the strip and feel like some hot (both temperature and spice) beef noodle soup, come and try this place.",
            "review_3": " The restaurant is really tiny and more of a cafe. The beef stew noodle is so perfect. Not too salty. Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter. ",

They recognize I am a new customer and came to check out if everything was good. Service is great! ",
            "review_2": "Really enjoyed this place! New fav spot for macaroons! I'd recommend the salted caramel, red velvet, creme brรยปlรยฉe & hazelnut. They have other exotic flavours like blueberry lavender, lychee raspberry, etc. You can ask for a glass of water and enjoy your treats on their patio. A box of six is $13 approx. And each one is $2.25",
            "review_3": " This place is a pastry heaven when you walk in. The eclairs, macarons, cakes are absolutely gorgeous looking. \n\nI've had the eclairs and macarons. Eclairs are very good!! The shoe pastry is stuffed full!! I tried their mango passionfruit and it was YUM! Macarons were perfect and a bit cheaper than nadege so I'm definitely going back. \n\nThese pastries make excellent presentable little gifts for family and friends :) ",
            "review_4": " Stopped in just to check it out. The cakes are gorgeous and everything looked yummy. I went home with two macaroons, blueberry lavender and vodka cranberry and I will definitely be going back to try the many other flavours. They were by far the best macaroons I've ever had! ",
            "review_5": "I was quite excited about this place due to the visual presentation of their baked goods. Got 6 macarons and 6 eclairs which were packaged in a nice velvet box. They had some cool flavor combos for the macarons but flavor wise, it fell short. The eclairs were okay, didn't have a crisp bite to it. However, they are presented really well. There are better spots on queen west.",
            "review_6": " Delysees has got to be the best French bakery/patisserie in Toronto\n\nI have been here twice - first time for macarons and the second time for croissants. They have decent coffee drinks here but the pastries definitely takes the cake (pardon the pun)\n\nReally great tasting macarons - lots of different flavours and priced reasonably. The fresh croissants are like fluffy heavenly pillows - so buttery, flakey and soft. I would eat these daily if I lived closer. Their eclairs look absolutely stunning but I haven't gotten around to them yet.\n\nDefinitely looking to come back to Delysees to try their other offerings! ",
            "review_7": " Beautiful interior, delicious sweets, and luxurious drinks. This is a gorgeous place and the desserts are wonderful! Definitely try the cheesecake, to die for! Also the hot drinks are very nice in this cold weather! The owner/workers are super sweet too and they are passionate about what they do and will help you pick if you cant make a choice! ",
            "review_8": "Love everything!!! Its hard to choose my favourite but if I have too...it will be the gold eclair!!( Its a must try!!) its a dark chocolate with hazelnut yummmmmmyy!!"

Right from the outstanding customer service of Beverly in the office to the ground crew and pilots, this is a first class service.\n\nFor anyone wanting to go I make one recommendation:  do this at the beginning of your Phoenix adventure as it is very dependant on the weather.

He had a lot of knowledge of the area and explained the history of what we were flying over and seeing, as well as provided recommendations for other things to do when we landed. The crew provided breakfast and a birthday cake for us which was really sweet. I have nothing bad to say about this I recommend Hot Air Expeditions over the competitors."

(Jalapeรยฑo popper type things - tasty!)\n\nSome of the folks at the table ordered ramen, etc. too.\n\nVery nice, and we'll have to try it again on a weekend sometime soon ",

The rice fell apart under the nigiri pieces. The fish slices were slim and the quality was the same as Teharu(cheap and easy). The spicy tuna roll that came with the combo was bland and smushy. 40$ later, I'd rather have spent my sushi bucks elsewhere. Plus sides: clean, nice interior, patio. Service was typical.",

Then had the smoked salmon nigiri which was perfect, then the fire blue special roll and the blazing shrimp. Both were amazing but the blazing shrimp was my favorite, spicy but not kill you spicy. All in all we will be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a good sushi place!k ",

Both were amazing, the chicken is juicy and grilled to perfection with that amazing charcoal taste. My only complaint with the plate is the haphazard salad, literally some iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, dry with no dressing. That with the fact that the eat-in area is very dirty and poorly maintained is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars.",

The bread was fluffy and fresh and the sandwich was loaded with chicken. I will definitely be coming back here to try the filet mignon sandwich as well. For $6.50 the sandwich is a great deal.

Well, actually, the only good reason that I can think of is that you are eating at Studio B Buffet.  BUT other than that, there isn't one good reason for me to not visit this fabulous establishment for a bit of sweetness if you are in M Hotel anyways.  No excuses! Yum!",

I was drawn to the Cronuts and wanted the cinnamon one...the lady behind the counter suggested the chocolate one, so I got both.  OMG, it was delish!. It was a nice size and the flavor was dang good.  I did prefer the chocolate one over the cinnamon one.  I later tried the pumpkin bread they have seasonal, its in slices--soo moist and yummy!  Try this little bakery if ur at M...soo delicious! ",

I feel like I should have gotten one of everything but in a rush to get to the airport I ordered a chocolate croissant.  Although tasty, I prefer the chocolate to be consistent throughout the entire pastry, not just a clump in the middle.  I wish yelp let you review restaurants in European cities because the Chocolate Pistachio croissant at La Durree in Paris is the closest the to heaven I've ever tasted.  It's worth a trip to Paris just to have a treat and cafe creme at La Durree. ",

And all of the desserts look so pretty and well put together.\n\nBut, in the end, 98% of the time, I just go for the gelato. And it is some really great gelato. Hint: Go for two scoops and choose two different flavors that compliment each other. Personally, the mix of coconut and chocolate chip is a fav.",

Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun.\nWas good food and fun.

The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense.

The flavor and cooking was on point; guac was also noms.\n\nThe decor was sweet and they had a nice (slightly hipster) vibe going on. Service was friendly. Unfortunately didn't try the drinks this time but they seemed promising.\n\nOverall, a great food-preggers-inducing experience. Looking forward to returning to my new favorite Mexican place ;)"

The classic frozen with a chambord float is my favorite and they do it well here.\n\nThe salad carbon was off the chain- served on a big platter and worked for me as 2 full dinners.",
            "review_2": " For delicious Mexican food in north Phoenix, try La Piรยฑata. This was our visit here and we were so stunned by the speed in which our food was prepared that we were sure it was meant for another table. The food was hot and fresh and well within our budget. My husband got a beef chimichanga and I got bean and cheese burrito, which we both enjoyed. Chips and salsa arrived immediately; the salsa tastes sweeter than most and is equally flavorful. We will be back! ",

Everything we had so far was great.  We will return. Highly recommended. ",

Very poor customer service and I have no intentions of ever coming there or recommending it to my friends."

We had a flight(6) plus an extra (they were already sold out of 3 since opening day on tue!) the three that were memorable to us were Frontside which is their west coast IPA and it was a smooth citrus hop. Midnight run which was not as sweet as your typical coffee stout but still had a hit of chocolate. The Mijo was amazing it's a triple IPA (10.4 abv) and you could really taste the peach and mango flavors. I wish them all the best this place is great!",

Super chill and awesome beer. We will be back! ",

On my next visit I think I'm just going to tell Skaught ( I believe that's the owner's name ) to surprise  me & do what ever to my hair , I've seen his work & it's amazing !!",

I got a partial bayalage\nAnd really like how it turned out. I think going from black to some lighter color was a shock, but it's perfect for summer around the corner. Thx Megan! ",

            "review_2": " So excited to have a ramen place in the NW. We have been back a few times. \n\nPros: good portion sizes, friendly service, great tasting ramen, clean interior, cool that they have outlets to charge your phone \n\nCons: prices are a little steep, no options for kids' portions or pricing, no delivery yet\n\nAll in all, a good experience at this place and a nice option for ramen if we don't feel like heading to Chinatown. ",
            "review_3": "Mediocre ramen with terrible service. They harass you for the first 5 minutes of sitting down then pretend you don't exist for the next 40.

Okay ramen and nice to have something on this side of town but won't be coming back due to terrible service.",

Having worked in F&B  for the last 25 years it's hard to sit down in a restaurants and give an unbiased opinion on any amount of money that I am spending for a meal good or bad. This is also the only place for Ramen in a 10 mile radius so we will keep coming back for now. Also I noticed the \"Owners\" sitting at the back table counting their money I thought that was very tacky get an office.",

I don't recommend people to go there for special occasions...\nI would give \n1  for the hostess /managers \n4  stars for the server because it was not his fault about the dessert plate.. it was for the people that made \nmy reservation..",

We ordered the big night out with the artisanal charcuterie which the waiter forgot until we had eaten the cheese course so we got extra cheese! Yay! We did the Swiss Gruyere and it was awesome.  The seasoning blend they have to sprinkle on the salad is great, I have bought bottles of this as stocking stuffers before.  We had herb encrusted chicken, pacific shrimp, sirloin and filet.  For dessert we had the chocolate and dulce de leche fondue."

My go-to is usually the traditional green tea, no sweetness, tapioca topping with honey and peach/mango flavors. Or I would get the golden lemonade. \n\nFuku is a really popular place to hang out with friends, do casual meet-ups, or even study.

Fuku Tea also sells loose, hot teas, which I will definitely be trying in the winter. I'm considering coming here from now on for at least their bubble tea. ",

I like both their green tea and black tea though so far I prefered green tea as it has a lighter taste in my opinion.

It changes EVERYTHING for me since I'm lactose-intolerant. I ordered the small Thai iced tea with soy milk and it tasted DELICIOUS. The tapioca pearls were soft and chewy. Prices were fair. \n\nI will come back here for future boba tea purchases! ",

Glad to see they rinse their tapioca until they are fully hydrated and then hold them in a warm crock prior to serving, so they are not under-cooked at all upon serving.\n\nAlso, they don't skimp out on bubbles, I got about half a cup in a small tea.

I asked the guys at Superior for a recommendation on a place to get the top repaired since they are family owned and operated.  When I went to their recommended place (West Charelston Auto Upholstery) the Todd Craik at WCAU did the repair free of charge.\n\nAbout 1 month ago I wanted to sell my old 2004 Honda Civic, which had a cracked windshield.  I asked Superior for their best cash price (i.e. Green $ no credit card) and the finished the installation in 35 minutes with an appointment all for $140!  They are competitive and fast!",

I spoke to Chris who quoted me a price that was nearly half of every other company I called.

Chris was accommodating to my last minute schedule changes, open to any questions and concerns I had, and (most importantly) he stayed true to his price quote and didn't try to get more money out of me.

Why not but actually we'd like to taste it.  I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good..  The make your own salad with up to ten items was great.  Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good.  We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along.  Will go back. ",

Oysters, crab legs, etc. The family style was great, as everyone could try the perfectly cooked steak, scallops, or salmon (the chicken was fine, but everything else was significantly better). \n\nService was also top notch. There were several people continually helping with each course and making adjustments (wait for the next course, bring the next one faster, etc.). At the end, there was a small mixup with the pricing but that was quickly resolved. ",

I must say the buser was fantastic.  Our server was too chatty about nothing and was not helpful in making choices. Drinks went dry often this night, we would getr so partched.\n\nFod was fabulous. Appetizer octopus and smelt fries were tasty and inovative.  The angry lobster and grilled scallops were perfect.  Spicy lobster on a bed of fideo with baby leeks, artichokes and fennel.  The scallops were so tender just warmed through.",

For an appetizer we ordered the king crab legs, which were nice and fresh and provided just enough for 3-4 of us to sample a couple legs.  I ordered the salmon and had it cooked medium.  Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I believe the others ordered scallops, steak, and pasta.  Definitely worth checking out if you win some money at the casino, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere considering the steep price for the good, but not excellent food."

They have made a couple new brews as of late that I sampled and all are really good. I love that they are right across the way from Noda Brewery and tend to always go to both of them during my visits. I love the games and the free peanuts. For the quality of the beer, I feel the prices are really good. Hoping to see some additional brews in the future. ",

They have a great outdoor area and, most importantly, their beer is quality.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of flavored beers. \nIPA POR VIDA!\nbut! their Jalapeno Pale Ale!? Hello deliciousness. Seriously. Give it a try. ",

From the peanuts on the table to the friendly bartenders, this place just felt homey as soon as you sat on a stool. But unlike other dive this bar has delicious beer and an a chill atmosphere that really makes the beer go down quick and easy. \n\nI am looking forward to visiting again! ",
            "review_8": "We thought that we would give this place a shot considering the positive reviews.  However our visit was all but positive.  First of all I don't believe that the air conditioning was working.  I know that in the past some places do this to encourage the beer consumption.  I don't necessarily have a problem with this but if thats the case at least make sure that the beer is cold.  I spoke to someone up at bar and she basically said that because the beer is brewed there its not served cold but just slightly colder than room temperature.  If I wanted a warm pint of bitter I'll go to the U.K.  Needless to say we won't be back."

I recommend the Beef Chow Fun, Walnut Prawns, & the Fried Flounder. The walnut prawns are by far the best I've ever had, they are not completely soaked in the mayonnaise. There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination. The flounder is fried to a crisp and juicy. Overall, you're paying for what you get and this is a must stop in Vegas. ",

There's the usual spring rolls, fried rice, and soup you can go with but for such a high end restaurant I was expecting a little more. \n\nThe one thing you absolutely HAVE to try though is their Jasmine tea.

            "review_2": " The wine bar has a nice selection of wines, albeit a little on the expensive side. The service was decent although flagging down someone for another glass at times can be a bother. This seemed to be an issue for tables that were further from the bar. It was also nice to have the store right next door now as opposed to being across the street. ",
            "review_3": " WInes by the glass change all the time.  A place where knowing about wine is helpful, but the choices are so well selected you won't make a mistake if you don't know anything.  The small plates are Really good.  Patio is great for people watching.  The wine flights are perfect for trying out new things! Love going here with girlfriends after a good movie right down the street(walking distance) at Phillips place theater. ",
            "review_4": " I really love that this place is here & you can find speciality items that normal grocers don't carry. I was able to find some products I've had my eye on for a long time(the coconut cult probiotic yogurt)& ghee butter by fourth & heart. \n\nI love that this place is close by but omg it's expensive. I was so excited to find the goods but was also shock on how expensive they were. But overall I do plan to go back & try their deli. The fresh food looked & smelled soooo good!! It's a must I go back ",
            "review_5": " I thought I'd write a short update to D&D Wine Room....\n\nThursday night Hubster and I went here for a glass-o-vino and to celebrate three things.  Me, My birthday, and the weekend.  LOL! I love everyone here.  So friendly, so nice, and....is that someone playing an acoustic guitar??  Such a wonderful touch!!  Sitting on the patio underneath the trees lined with white Christmas lights and listening to the amazing singer sing \"Marry Me\" almost brought me to tears.  It's the simple things in life....\n\nI heart you D&D wine room....thank you for a great Thursday night! ",
            "review_6": " Who would have thought that December would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at Dean and DeLuca?  That is what I did today and it was divine.   I love coming here to build my own salad.  I had the pear vinaigrette dressing and I could have sucked that up through a straw.  Even though it is a little pricey, the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best.  It's also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items.  The atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping.  Definitely a winner in Charlotte. ",
            "review_7": " I always stop in for a delicious sandwich before a movie. But, like an abusive relationship, I keep coming back for the hot sandwiches no matter how many times I get burned by the customer service. ",
            "review_8": " The Dean & Deluca wine room never fails to deliver some of the very best food in Charlotte. No pretense, just really great quality food with a creative flair, and good spirited and attentive service. And they recently added valet parking making a visit to Phillips Place on a Fri or Saturday night seamless."

The drinks are over priced and the service is just okay. My card was misplaced for 5 minutes. The bartender told me she handed it back to me. I would know if my card was given back to me especially if it was on top of the receipt. I was made to feel really uncomfortable because I was told that I had misplaced my own card. The card was finally located in the bartenders cup which holds all of the receipts and cards. So it wasn't my fault.  Not sure if I will be back.",

            "review_2": " This is some of the most interesting and delicious food I've had in a LONG time. You get seated, then go up and load up your bowl. Many different meat choices, lots of veggies, and some very tasty sauces. Your food is cooked on a big grill, and normally comes out very quickly. The staff is always very nice to me. Will be coming back soon! ",
            "review_3": " Great selection of fresh meats and vegi's - sauces are to die for; reasonably priced and kids love it.    Watch out for coupons, they have them often. ",
            "review_4": "Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken.",
            "review_5": "This place should be great.  It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run.  The service is sporadic and the erratic.   The proteins in the food bar were frozen.  The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away.   We got our appetizer after our entree.",
            "review_6": "This was a fun place to eat,  you can build your own bowl (like a typical mongolian restaurant) and they have an unlimited option for $4 more which is great for trying different creations.  One thing i really liked was the \"starch\"  options. They offer noodles and rice,  but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element. Very reasonably priced.",
            "review_7": "So far the best experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my entire life. I'm from India and moved to San Francisco in 2009 and I'm visiting family in charlotte. I believe our server name was BILL and he was very nice and polite and friendly. I haven't experienced that in many places. I felt so comfortable and welcoming. And of course the food was awesome I was kind of frustrated with the process but man the food came out great. Thanks for this great experience. You guys need to bring this to San Francisco!! And not to mention the free refills on the drinks and you can choose different drinks as well.",
            "review_8": "Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9.99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook. Good thing I had a coupon so I was able to shave a little off the total. I think one visit is good enough for me."

The steak was good, although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse. I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum! ",
            "review_2": " Hadn't been there in several years and after this visit I remember why, I don't like onions or shallots in my macaroni and cheese. The food is good but not worth the price just a very disappointing experience and I probably won't go back ",
            "review_3": " My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary (literally every year we have been married). The service is exceptional and the food quality is top-notch. Furthermore, the happy hour is one of the best in the Valley. In addition to excellent drinks, they offer free prime filet steak sandwiches. I highly recommend this place for celebrations or a nice dinner out. ",
            "review_4": " I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there. ",
            "review_5": " Very good steak house.  Steaks are high quality and the service was very professional.  Attentive, but not hovering.  Classic menus and atmosphere for this kind of restaurant. No surprises. A solid option, but not a clear favorite compared to other restaurants in this category. ",
            "review_6": "Had a wonderful experience here last night for restaurant week. Had the filet... Which was amazing and cooked perfectly with their yummy mashed potatoes and veggies. The bottle of red wine they offered for an additional $20 paired perfectly with the dinner. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!",
            "review_7": " The seafood tower must change in selection of seafood, which is good, which is also why mine last night was so fresh fresh delicious.  Its good to know that you can get top rate seafood in Phoenix.  Bacon wrapped scallops were very good, and I sacrificied a full steak (opting for the filet medallion) to try the scallops.  I asked for medium rare steak, but maybe shouldve asked for rare...my cousin had the ribeye and could not have been any happier than he was :)  \n\nyum for fancy steak houses.  \nIts an ultra romantic place to, fyi.\nthe wait staff is very attentive. ",
            "review_8": " Donovans, how can you go wrong.  Had some guests in town and some fantastic steaks paired with some great cabernets.  Really enjoyed my filet and lobster."

We are regulars in Gilbert at a number of places and I have been to just about every worthwhile wine bar, tapas place, or cocktail lounge in AZ and a lot of the west coast and this place doesn't compare.  The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music.  The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff.  I ordered a burger with no cheese and of course it has cheese.  No dairy, a simple request.  Made another and it was practically raw.  I should give it 1 star but whatever.  Won't be back.",
            "review_2": " I am smitten with the Barrelhouse. Justin, Eric, and Sandy made my experience wonderful. They had a flirty menu of cocktails that played sultry, sensory  games in my mouth....providing me with a balance of flavors and the tastes of true mixology. I was impressed with the staffs knowledge and passion for all things mixable and drinkable. Haha. I recommended these guys for their unforgettable spirits,  fine conversations, and an immeasurable  quality of service. Simply sweet. ",

Stopped there for lunch today and had the Harvest Salad (beets, blue cheese, candied pecans, jicama, and field greens) and split the chocolate pot de creme with a friend. Heaven!!

From the thick cut potato chip snack, the warm cheddar bisquits through the salad of field greens with candied pecans and blue cheese, to the duck confit and lobster baked chili rellenos, everything was a feast for the tastebuds.

Waited 5 minutes at the door and was never acknowledged by the three servers who walked by and got themselves drinks instead or the person on the phone who saw us and didn't acknowledge us either. There was also a customer wandering around trying to pay her bill with no one coming to help. \nPerhaps if they fix the wait staff we will try again. If this was a problem in an almost empty restaurant I can't imagine what it's like when it's crowded.",
            "review_4": " Had a lovely time here last night with my girlfriend. The inside interior is very cool and modern- a good retreat from the heat of Vegas. We ordered the mussels, Quattro Stagianno pizza, and the Alla Vodka Pasta with meatballs. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, but favorite was the alla vodka pasta!! It was so yummy we even forgot to take a picture of it. Recommend getting this for sure. We also got the house made cheesecake- really yummy and different. It's like if you mix a cannoli with a cheesecake. \nOverall- authentic, great date spot, comfort food, and top notch service. ",

The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar.

Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time.

The Tofu Pad Se Ew tasted like bad chinese hor fun take-out and was extremely salty and spicy (even though I ordered a spicy level of 2 of 5).  The Tofu Pad Se Ew also had a random piece of chicken in it, which was very weird. Had I been a vegetarian I would have been very upset. \n\nEvery other Thai place I'd been too has waaaaay better Pad Se Ew. Stick to this place if you want salty basic/meh chinese type food.",
            "review_2": "I wasn't a big fan of this place for a few years. The food is really good now. This is my 2nd time here, I just had it last weekend. I got jap chap with chicken and green curry with chicken and coconut rice, I couldn't decide which one I wanted. It didn't disappoint. Today I got the sautรยฉed mango with shrimp and extra coconut rice. I am so glad this place turn itself around. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep it up.",

Only urbanspoon had a menu and I asked saying it was from 2011 and was told that was right.  When I later called to place the order, the price was $14 more than what the menu on urbanspoon had. I hung up and redid the math and called again.  I was told if I was unhappy with their prices I could go elsewhere, no apology for an employee telling me to find an inaccurate menu online.  I was pretty surprised by the rude customer service.",

Would not order again. \n\nFor the meal, ordered the drunken noodle. The noodles where not the good fat noodles...but the thin ones. That stinks. Very mild flavor and spice. Try a different dish. \n\nI'm not sure if this restaurant just caters to the American palate but they need more flavor. ",
            "review_6": " Situated at the very end of the sprawling Settlers Ridge shopping/dining complex, this is a decent option for Thai fare. The service is always fast and friendly even during the lunch rush. No bar but they are BYOB friendly. I'm a curry guy and usually get the Massaman with extra veggies and coconut rice. I like it a lot. GrapeWife has tried several dishes and liked them all. The high ceiling in the dining room creates a spacious yet comfortable atmosphere. The round enclosed booth offers some privacy I you're into that. Give them a try. I think you'll be pleased. ",
