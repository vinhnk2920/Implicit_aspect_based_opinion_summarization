#NAME?,"Woww!   My order:  Chicken Schwarma with a side of hummus and pita.   Order of falafel. Cucumber drink.  Side of garlic sauce.  Side of cucumber sauce.  

Absolutely clean filling.  Taste delicious!   Will have you craving for more. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this restaurant sooner.  After the fact I realize this place is all the rave! ",I tried to order steak kebob but they made beef kebob. I asked for tzaziki on the side but they covered all the meat with tzaziki. Taste is more like middle eastern. Not Mediterranean. Price is good. Taste is okay.,Now this place is really good i always drive past it but today i decided to stop an check it out it is really good healthy an fresh,I was thinking this would be more of a sit down restaurant where you order from the table instead of a chipotleish style of Mediterranean food.  Thought there would be more room inside for eating.  The only thing good I had was the cucumber chiller which I would go back for.  Not so much the food/service.,Parsley Modern Mediterranean is wonderful.  Very responsive staff.  Food is wonderful.  I usually get the wraps (chicken or beef are my go-tos).  Babaganoush and the warm pita bread is pretty amazing.," Very delicious food in love with cucumber drink, couldn't decide what I wanted and one specific Gentelman whipped up something very amazing for me! By the name of Jamil great service! Thanks you and will definitely be back! ","This is Chipotle for Mediterranean food. And it. is. delicious.

I've only been here once because the location is very inconvenient for me and I'm extremely lazy about driving more than 5 minutes to go anywhere, but if it were closer, I'd be here all the time.  (It's probably better this way, I have very little self-control.)

If you like spicy - get the hot sauce.  Mix it with the white sauce, you won't be disappointed.",The food always taste fresh and leaves me very full without feeling tired.  They have had a groupon for a very long time making this place an incredible value. This is my favorite Mediterranean place.,"Fresh food, high quality food, delicious and Mediterranean.. what more can one ask for. I loved eating here and I really enjoyed the food here. It's one of those places that once you eat there you want to keep coming back, and you will. Prices are good. If you want to customize your order they'll do it for you. Awesome place.",Hlk4DnrP3qsO_FK-ZHVycA,0dHOq_7RgWYbnJo6zRdArA,KoMEWvVXO5OD4FRZ1Fxq0w,0MW_KjLiD6bMaf-cwaP-GA,#NAME?,oA-id2KOgN7TVc2mR1-sWg,yL3u5r0pNZt-efgGsTMeAQ,YWe5wjOjInPmrAQWLTxhJA
2JsLzYF8rUalwpm5LDEcog,"just excellent.  friendly staff, good food, funky atmosphere.  there should be lines around the block to get in.  lobster bisque was excellent, the lobster shrimp tacos excellent.  seafood Ã©touffÃ©e excellent.  don't miss the desserts, just fabulous. ",Food very good. Small unassuming atmosphere with great seafood. The clam chowder is very peppery so not for the weak at heart.,Over priced specials.  Not good. The clam chowder was good. Everything else mediocre at best.  Place smells too," The Falls' hidden gem -- kooky decor, decadent food at a reasonable price. No reason why you shouldn't be eating here. ",Fantastic place with phenomenal food. Very unique. Able to bring your own alcohol for a small fee.  Family atmosphere with exceptional service. One of my new favorites for sure.," Very cool decor and atmosphere, but extremely limited menu and both times we were there, they were out of something we ordered. Also, a little pricey for what you get. "," This is my second time visiting---and the food has always been tasty.  They don't skip on the seafood.  We didn't come with a reservation, which kind of threw them off their game. Food didn't come out very quickly this time, however, there was a large party so for the small kitchen it was understandable.  My fav item tonight was the salted carmel cheesecake. The reason for the three star review is because they do not accept credit/debit cards...cash or check only. ",Very good! Many items made from scratch and fish is cleaned there. The portions aren't too big. Everything was flavored well. Would def return.,"The food is great here. It can be a little expensive, but that doesn't take away from the good quality food.

6C_8Mh4lmLc_QEs3hHleBg,"It could be a lot better, but with no competition around, they dont have to be. 

The chicken is basic charbroiled, some times overcooked & dry, averagely seasoned, and portions are ok. 

Sirloin is adequate, plays it safe with the amount of marinade & spice. But at least its decently quality & tender meat. 

Beans are average beans & they fill their role as a side item just fine. 
The salsa is terrible mashed tomatoes. 

Service is lacking, slow, and cash only is annoying. ","Nice simple Mexican food at a great price, love the charbroiled steak and the beans so flavorful with out a lot of stuff added. Called my order in but when I walked inside the smell was so good I had to tell them to make mine to eat in. Next time I will try the combo cause the beef was so tasty I know that charbroiled chicken will be just a good if not better. Just remember CASH ONLY you can eat for as little as $5 but bring $10 and you can get anything you want."," We call this ""Red Chicken."" It's consistently good, always fresh and tasty and you can't beat the prices. I love both the chicken and the beef. The beans are rather bland, but the salsa, rice,  and pickled onions all go together for an explosion of flavor. ","My bro and I have found this place by chance. The smell from the restaurant street were delicious and we couldn't wait to taste it! The best beef and chicken you'll find in Phoenix! And it's only 15 minutes away from the airport! For sure, I will recommend it!"," To my homesick Indianz from Arizona, if you want home cooked food (beef, beans, tortillas) this is THE PLACE.  Tri-tip grilled on actual mesquite, tortillas that taste as close to homemade as possible, and they will actually grill jalapenos for you.  And the beans, oh the beans, just like Moms.  Eat here, you will be happy. ",This is as close as the chicken that you will get in Mexico this stuff is to die for you can't even simulated  at home with the El Pollo Loco seasoning salt. we go to Rocky Point Mexico and gotta stop and get the chicken in town right on the Main Street it's killer.," I like this place. The food here is like what you'd get at a typical taco stand in Nogales, but without the dysentery.

The chicken and beef are equally tasty, but I tend to favor the beef because it's boneless and less work trying to get it all into the tortillas. "," One of the best deals and delicious beef and chicken combinations out there. It is a whole in the wall and just a gem. I will totally cater with a tray of this stuff, but may end up hoarding it to myself.",Mexican food that reminds me of what my mom used to make. It is fresh and high quality but simple and not overly complicated. The chicken is by far their specialty here and if you stop by I recommend trying it. The price is very cheap here but one down side is they only accept cash.,5ud2XvuANEOANbJOcNzkqw,zE8tx-I74lG_zgZzz0i8bA,bJErmLrf_Bn9lTGxEYq8kg,SCsgTWYz0nLhdejjAf8qaw,V4b-P4Cn7lBCS9FhTxkUHg,MxskpXmEU4y61C9KTrj-2A,oI9AX9shV2UUdg-aXY385A,Rjqfk9_As4k6z5AuRw7bRA

I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place. "," Not good at all. The young staff basically ignores you if you have any grey hair. The food was just OK, but I won't be back. The Good Egg is much better. ",Great hip breakfast in Gilbert. Food and waitress Kayla were excellent. Reviews didn't do it justice. We will be back.,"Visited for the first time this morning and even though it was recommended by a friend who'd dined 2-3 times before I was hesitant seeing all the negative reviews. We thought it was great! Arrived at 8:15, sat on the patio and had great food & service. We had the brioche french toast, waffle dogs & scrambled eggs - all were great! We will definitely be back.","I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent.  But we came here for food not to meet the staff.  Food was just really mediocre, not even hot.  The hashbrowns taste pre-cut and frozen.  The ""real maple syrup"" is just a maple syrup blend.  I could make a lot better food myself.  We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack.  All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's.  Would rather IHOP across the street.   Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here (before nypd pizza).",We love the service and food. The staff is always friendly. Daniela always takes care of us and remembers us by name!!! It's our favorite breakfast place.,"Had the biscuits and gravy...they were OK. (Bland, not as warm as they could have been).  Also couldn't help but notice the couple sitting next to us, sending both of their meals back for being cold.  
I realize this location has just opened - so I may wait a while before giving Over Easy another go.
3 stars are for our friendly waitress and the yummy Bloody Mary mix."," I really never post any reviews but this place deserves it. I come here often and the food tastes great like always. The brioche banana toast are to die for as well as the pancakes, I've really never tasted anything like it before. The place is cozy and clean and the staff is amazing, not really much more to ask for except I wish they add crepes that would the cherry on top.","This is an ok breakfast joint.  The food is kind of bland for the hefty price you have to pay.  I had the Dolly breakfast sandwich and I feel like it lacked flavor.  The staff could be more attentive.

Typical business district downtown type eatery.  This is nothing fancy but it does hit the spot and is very well maintained.  If I were in the area, I would eat here again for a quick bite to eat for decent food and excellent service.   Food=3, Place=3, and Service=5.","This review is for the salad bar, I feel like I need to warn you.  It's a total rip-off because they weigh your food.  $13 and some change for a salad!  Need I say more.  I definitely would've left out the rubber tasting chicken and nasty croutons.  I will stick with Jason's Deli, better selection and you can have all the salad you want for one price."," I was looking for just a place to get breakfast and coffee that didn't involve flashing lights or clouds of smoke.  I was relived to find this cafe within walking distance of my downtown hotel!  I had a toasted marshmallow iced latte and a breakfast burrito.  I don't remember which one I ordered but it was a vegetarian burrito with avocado and egg as two main ingredients.  And isn't that what is really most important?  it was also fun to people watch all the law enforcement officers and legal professionals as they came in.  Plus, free wi-fi!  Will definitely come again. ",We found this place walking toward another breakfast cafe and decided to try their food instead. It was a great choice! Their food is really great and at a fair price too... We've since been back a couple times and have continued to enjoy this great spot! Antrese has been our server every time so far and we've been impressed by how nice and helpful she has been! Definitely recommend.," This place is my new favorite!  Their coffee is soo good, you can make a ton of different combinations or just stick to the basics.  Their selection of teas are great too and they are amazing quality!  Super yummy. I had a pesto chicken pannini that was effing delicious.  The staff is super nice, the girls are really sweet.  Everything about this place it's awesome.   Totally go there! "," Let`s start with the good stuff first. Clean place and friendly workers. The paninis are great (a bit overpriced) but you definitely get what you pay for as it is a big portion. The buffet is great especially if you`re down on cash and want a variety of food on your plate. 

Cons: Breakfast is not great at all! I would definitely not recommend it at all. I`d rather go to Mcdonald`s for the same quality of food at a much, much lesser price. "," Awesome place for nice coffee and great delicious food!!! 
I would definitely recommend it ! 
Our new favorite restaurant for lunch in Downtown Las Vegas  
Thanks to the beautiful owner, Silvia! "," Great lunch spot downtown. Food tastes good. They also have one of the best-tasting coffees around - they use Illy, of course. Prices reasonable.","This place has a nice buffet, which in itself is a compliment and a negative. Their actual food they bring you isn't as good as the buffet in general, and they charge you by weight at the salad bar which is something you wouldn't really expect. It can come out expensive.

Here's a summary of Rosemary's:
fine dining that's not on the strip
excellent service
high but not extravagant prices
delicious food

One star off for the decor inside - a drop ceiling when people are spending $100/head??? 

*note: $75/person no show fee on weekend reservations!"," Rosemary's is a great little restaurant. I have been there many times and it's always good. It is more of a fine dining place without the expense. I had a fantastic butternut squash soup with pepitas. My husband loved the sweetbreads (the brain kind, not the bread kind). The menu has something for everyone, whether they're picky or adventurous. I have never a had a bad meal here. And by eating there you support local business which is always a good thing. "," They're a bit off the strip, but not a far cab ride away.

Haven't been back to Vegas recently, but still remember that this place is amazing. The service is blow-your-mind adorable. The wait staff is incredible and they're such sweethearts. Eventhough I found their lamb very ""lamb-ie"" (which ""if it tastes that way, then the chef wanted it that way,"" ), I was still so impressed with everything else that it didn't even matter. 

Rosemary's is one of my FAVORITE restaurants ever. "," I have been going to Rosemary's for years. I have even been there for winemaker dinners. Rosemary's is the kind of place you should go to once a year or so. I really can't describe this place. Honestly, every high end restaurant I go into, I compare to this place. The location will throw you off. It is WAY off the strip. Which is great because you don't get the crazy bachelor/bachlorette party's.

This is very much a local place. It is reputation is on word of mouth. I always say it is the place you take your secretary to if you don't want your wife to know. lol ","Sad News.... 

Looking forward to my second visit here since May of 2010....

I called today for reservations and was told they closed for good.

Very sad... awesome place!"," Best restaurant I have ever eaten at.  Not the best location, but inside is great.  Service is wonderful.  The food is better than anything I have had on the strip. ","I'm a fan.

I've been there perhaps 10 times?  Never had a bad dinner.

Always with great service, consistent food quality.

One criticism would be that their menu is pretty...ehh...unchanging.

I think it's almost the same stuff all the time.  It does get a little old and although having your staples menu is good, it needs change.","go for lunch...good deal for $23!
the shrimp dish was aite.
the mahimahi is a must!
and the pecan pie was heaven!

service was top notch...

don't think could come for dinner...quite expensive!
nicely decorated!
really loved the bathrooms, very cute!","If you're in Vegas and want to head off the strip for some great food Rosemary's is a great place to check out. Some of the decor is a little dated but don't let that deter you. The food that they make is amazing, and has a lot of the home made flavor that you are looking for.

The place has some very weird art on display bot other than that the staff is very friendly. 

I will be coming here often. ","Very good wraps from this cool spot in Tremont.  Easy to get in and out of.  I only picked up and carried out.  It was a 90 degree day and I don't think they had air in there so I am not sure how comfortable it would be to eat in.  As far as the food goes, it is simple and fresh ingrediants that are priced well.  I reccomend."," This place is sweet! I tried their special sandwich of the day - veggie grilled cheese. It had cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and lots more delicious veggies. The sandwiches are huge so you'll definitely have some left overs! Can't wait to try more sandwiches and soups from this place. ","Best lunch option in tremont. Its that simple.  Sandwiches are creative and they do NOT skimp you on the meat. I have to say that i often have trouble finishing my entire sandwich. Turkey #27 is a mainstay and highly recommended + roasted red pepper and on the asiago cheese bread. Sandwiches come with Lays (baked or full-fat). The only drawback is that the sandwiches tend to come HEAVY on the mayo, do yourself a favor and always ask for it on the side.","I LOVE this place!  I do not eat meat and they have very creative options for meatless sandwiches.  There is one girl that works there that is way friendlier than the others.....if everyone acted like her, this would have been an easy 5 stars.

I think it was the chicken salad pesto sandwich amaaaazing!  La bodega is this nice little shop right at the corner of a quiet neighborhood The staff is really nice and quick. The food is all fresh and sandwiches come with some chips, there's a small selection of flavors to choose from. I would definitely return when in Cleveland! ","Amazing, amazing sandwiches/subs.  I believe that the last time I went I got the #45 and it was out of this world.  It blows away any chain restaurants such as Subway or Quizno's.

Everything tastes great and was truly fresh as advertised. I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). The eggs were fresh, the bacon looked and tasted like real bacon, the waffle was fluffy and delicious and the orange juice which came out of a gigantic plastic jar I'm sure was squeezed that morning. A+ "," So I had the pleasure of eating at both locations while in PHX and this one out did the original!  I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :).  For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese.  They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick.  Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight.  Prices were good so I strongly recommend! "," Quick service all around. Amazing food...

Great ok every way. 
Oh, and the bacon. The bacon was unbelievable. ",What a fantastic spot to grab a meal. I got the Bloody Mary and meatloaf. Every ingredient in the Bloody Mary was perfect. Extra crispy celery.

This place seems like the spot that would be packed all of the time, so expect to be rubbing elbows with a stranger while you eat. Aside from this, the food was great! I got their grilled cheese and french fries which were fantastic, they use a really thick bread which made the sandwich even better. I would definitely come here again...if I'm ever delayed and forced to fly Southwest again -_____-","This place is delicious.  Its a great place to go when you get off your flight, or if you are waiting for your plane to come.  It has delectable breakfast food.

A few years ago I also had the store gun smith change the sights on a few pistols and they did an excellent job. Whenever I purchase firearms out of state, I strongly recommend any Las Vegans to get it shipped to this location. "," This store is HUGE and is a great place to buy thinks for use in the outdoors. I love the entry with the life-size animals, the aquarium, and the water feature. Love this place. Come here if you need anything for the outdoors!! ",This was a fun place to visit even if you did not buy anything.  There were so many outdoor and sport gear.  An large aquarium and a large selection of hunted animal.  My friend from another country also felt fancinate to see a large selection of guns and ammo.  Guns were outlawed in some other country.," This place is a riot.  From a ""tourist"" stand point there is suprisingly alot of fun to be had.  Especially if you don't take yourself seriously.  My Dad, friend and I had an under cover security guard watching us closely by the time we left (not very sneaky sir).  Be sure to watch the fishing demonstration, watching live fish strike bait live is pretty dang cool.  If you're in Vegas, like the outdoors, and feel like releasing some of your redneck side, this place is great. ","Disappointed in the service we received today. The place was extremely packed with Holiday shoppers and only 4 checkout lanes were open. Stood in long lines to purchase our items and the cashier did not apologize for the wait, instead made the comment that she wasn't sorry because she has a job. Bass Pro should consider having a bigger staff this close to Christmas and have every checkout lane open."," I don't really actually shop at Bass Pro. But I love walking around, looking at everything, and playing the games at Bass Pro. It's a fun store to just meander about. And they have different shooting games, checkers, etc. that you can play. Plus there's the stream and waterfall with fish, turtles, and ducks, as well as all the stuffed critters all over the store. It's a free/cheap way to spend a couple of hours. And if you do happen to be into fishing and/or hunting, you'll find what you need here. All in all, I'm a fan simply because I always have fun walking around and looking at everything here. ","Purchased a pair of upland pants for hunting season on sale. Only paid $29. First time I wore them, I got them very dirty and the reinforced fronts ripped out. Returned for a full in store refund. Was only $29, but still, great service even though the product (Browning) was mediocre."," Went with my wife to go and check out the gun counter for their up and coming Black Friday sale and seen some firearms we wanted to buy that day that wasn't listed for the sale. The Employees all had rude trash attitudes especially one named Erwin. I spoke with the manager Brad and suggested that the employees in that department take a diversity education training.
Due to their ignorance I won't be shopping there again.",Fun place to visit the place was very large. It had a large aquarium and the fishing demonstration was top notch.

The staff is nice and they always greet you at the door. The line where you build your bowl is always tidy and looks pretty. The staff is always monitoring it to make sure everything looks good. The grill is always hot and they clean it often. So no old caked on burnt food from 2 hours ago. They offer doggie bags for .50. Trust me it tastes even better the next day too. Definitely a place that will fill you up.," My MIL's boyfriend took us here to meet up with some of his local family when they were in town. I didn't know what to expect walking in at all, and actually almost didn't come (we had some deliveries scheduled that day, but they finished early), and I'm so glad I made it! Others have described the process, and they're right. It is very tasty, but I did struggle with making my sauce, I didn't think the ingredients available were labeled very well. The employee helped me out and made the sauce I wanted though. I will say the beef was better than the chicken (in my opinion at least) so I'll be sticking with that next time. "," This isnt the worst food I have ever tried but I definitly will NOT be going back there anytime soon.

I dont know how fresh the vegetables are but it is a good alternative to fast food. 
The meat is frozen and kinda grossed me out so I recommend the tofu, although I cant speak for its quality.

The service was fast and you get to decide how much of each ingredient you want. "," Went into the resturant last night with my husband and daughter and baby. Didn't know how the whole system worked... The lady that checked us in explained everything and was super friendly.
The food tasted nice and fresh and the portion was huge. The kids were super excited to find out the meal came with ice cream at the end.
Right before we left the lady working at the front came and asked how everything was. The costumer service was on point and we will definitely be going back. ",I emailed the company just to let them know about my experience and the employees that were acting so unprofessional.  I was contacted (hadn't expected that) and was very impressed at the customer service and concern over my experience.

For some reason my online orders couldn't be processed so she call target.com for me and handle everything with them for me! Spoke to Terrence about it and he was great too!," Oh hey, it's a Target.

They don't have much of a grocery area, mostly dry goods but I love the $1 bins and their clearances, awesome!","This has to be one of my favorite Targets by far! Very clean and organized. I love shopping here because I don't feel rushed to grab and go like I do in Walmart, just to get away from the riff raff. I can never go in and just buy what I came in for! lol!

The shopping experience I get here is never negative in the slightest way. Great products, great prices, great store. Highly recommended. Only thing I don't like is being able to swipe my Target card and not needing to sign for purchases under $50. Better make certain I never lose my card!",I had the best experience with Jane! I came in today for a few things and am always in a rush. They pharmacy paged her and she opened up the locked toothbrushes in record time. Additionally she recommended some facial masks. She then checked me out and I was swiftly on my way. Jane had the sweetest disposition and was knowledgeable in her company's products. I was so delighted with her I opened up a Target card and want to continue shopping here! Awesome experience and totally brightened my day. :),If I could give them negative stars I would! Their price match policy is an absolute joke. Target will only honor the price match policy on THEIR OWN website if it lists a dollar amount not if lists buy one get one half off. Ridiculous. So now I get to go home repurchase everything online only to return it when it arrives so I can receive the second item at 50% off.  Losing another customer Target!,"Target is definitely my go to store for just about everything.  They're clean (this one is), affordable, good quality, no long lines, easy return/exchange, convenient parking and location, and great customer service!  

I've also been going to the pharmacy and I love their $4.00 prescription program.  Whether or not you have insurance they will still give it you for $4.00 as long as its in that list.  Their pharmacist and pharmacy tech are really nice, not like other pharmacies.","I've been to a lot of Targets in my life, and I must say, this is one of the better ones.

5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"The restaurant seems small compared to others in the hotel, but they packed several large parties into a separate room here for some reason.  Loved the dark wood decor, and the food was great, although the value for the price may be a negative factor.

My lamb saddle was delicious, and the martinis were excellent.  Service was very poor, mainly due to a server that would disappear for long stretches of time, so it took us a while to get our order even started.  

This was a nice, nice dinner, but I think for the price there are other better options in this hotel, and certainly in Vegas overall. "," Just had a small early brunch here.  Almost deserted for some reason.  But the food was very good.  Good service too.  Decor is traditional, but felt maybe a little out dated. "," Small portions for the price.

I guess it is ok if you dig the high end dining frech food scene, but it wasn't my thing. "," Really cute French Cafe in the Venetian Hotel.  Loved the decor, the cafe bistro tables and chairs.  I've had both breakfast and lunch here, both were excellent.  

Salad Nicoise had some nice pieces of seared tuna, I liked the slice of bagette toast with tapenade and an anchovie fillet.  Mussels Mariniere was also very good, lots of garlic!  The fries were not as good as Bouchon's but few are.  Don't think you can go wrong eating here. "," Saturday morning breakfast.

Hung over and in need of some food. I had the croquette monsieur, while the really hung over guy next to me had the pino omlette. He enjoyed as much as his stomach could handle.

Really friendly staff, and the food was good.

Odd decor around you for breakfast, but hey its french, and its vegas, so there's bound to be something not right. "," Originally, we plan on going to Bouchon. The manager told us that they were doing a yearly maintenance and had closed early. He then offered to walked us to Pinot Brasserie and told the hostess to take very good care of us because it was my boyfriend and i anniversary. 

Really good price for french food. We both enjoyed it very much. Pinot Royale chilled tray filled with shell fish was to die for. On top of that, the creme brÃ»lÃ©e that we ordered for dessert was on the house with ""happy anniversary"" written on the plate in chocolate. That totally made our night, not to mention everything was soooo DELICIOUS! "," By the end of the week here, I resorted to mostly soup and salad.

Here I tried the french onion soup which was salty, but a bit too cheesy as well.

To top it off, I had the Nicoise salad, tuna was okay, bit too peppery.  

I was full after lunch, but it could have been the soup that really filled me up.

Our afternoon server was definitely very much in the joking mood and provided great entertainment for the table. "," Before this dinner we popped into La Cave and maybe my taste buds were on the high from the fresh food but when we got here for dinner I was disappointed. 
The decor was very typical and nothing to write home about. Our waitress didn't seem that on ""her game"" that evening - forgetting specials and how things are prepared that are on the menu everyday. Food was just ok - i have had a steak much better prepared than this one.","This is a decent restaurant.  They serve both breakfast and lunch.  I had the Nicoise salad.  It was ok.

These are the must have : Pork Cheek, Pork Belly, Beef Tounge and Saba Shio. If you still have room, they serve the best sushi in town as well. "," Excellent food, excellent variety, excellent prices!  Our group of four enjoyed the experience of trying all sorts of new foods and combinations with prices reasonable enough to get adventurous.

If you're looking for great boba milk tea, Tea Street is the place to go.","Went here 2 days ago and it was my first visit. I live around the corner and had been skeptic to try a new boba place since I already had my favorite on Dobson. I can say for a first visit this place is AMAZING. Great service, my cousin loved it, they had so many drinks. I had gotten the green tea milk tea and was worried about the dairy bc I'm lactose intolerant but the cashier/tea barista assured me that all of the milk teas are dairy free, FANTASTIC. It was really good, great drinks and not to mention the cashier lady was super cute plus plus. 

I will be coming back.",Lots of different flavors of milk tea and every one I've tried has tasted amazing. Prices are reasonably fair compared to other tea and Boba places. Very friendly staff. I'd recommend trying the Brown Sugar Milk Tea if you like sweet drinks!," Visited again today, ordered matcha milk tea and earl grey milk tea. The barista made sure the drink wasn't too sweet, but both milk teas did not have the flavor of tea I was looking for in the last three milk teas I've tried (TeaStreet, Strawberry, Osmanthus). I won't hold that against them and hope to try more milk teas and top ten drinks. "," I'm sitting here, as we speak, digesting my large peach milk tea that had the popping lychee boba in it. 

Typically I'm waiting for that ""ugh I ate too much"" feeling that I get after boba or real sweet teas... 

Doesn't seem to be coming. 

The milk tea was super light and the peach tasted really good. Lychee added a bit of tartness which is fantastic. 

Huge menu! Can't wait to come back and try more. ","""Like! Green"", that's the drink I got...

You know how scotch whiskey and sushi can be an acquired taste? This drink is like that. 

Initially, this drink gives a overwhelmingly almond fragrance. I hated it, it was gross. However I spent 5 bucks on this damn drink, so I continued and begrudgingly sucked it up. Weirdly, as I was halfway done, I  stopped noticing the weird almond flavor and started tasting the green tea matcha. I'm confused, and probably will have something traditional at this place next time, if I have to come back.","The drinks here aren't so great, and that would normally make me give fewer stars, but their ""Grand Canyon"" on their Top 10 list is THA ABSOLUTE BOMB!! It's that great it makes up for anything and everything else. Don't bother coming here to drink anything else. The place could be dirty for all I care (it isn't), as long as you have a Grand Canyon you're having 5 's!!!"," The drinks here are great since they're freshly brewed and you can taste the tea, but the girl working had to hustle to get all drinks made and take the orders at the same time.

I felt bad ordering six drinks while she already had other drinks ordered that she didn't make yet with a group of people in line behind me.

I drenched in their signature tomato based bbq sauce which was my favorite part of the meal.   The pulled pork was good as well but the brisket was so much better.  I felt the bun on the sandwich could have  been toasted more as it was kind of dry.  I will definitely be back to try their ribs, the customer service was excellent. ",Best Pittsburgh Bbq!

The ribs were the highpoint of the meal and were among the worst I've ever had. Yinz better stay far away. "," I'm a big BBQ fan, but unfortunately YinzBurgh is only middle-of-the road. On the one hand, their meals are cheap and filling, which is great, but the BBQ isn't the best I've had. Mostly, the meat seems a bit dry.

If you are in Pittsburgh looking for BBQ, I would recommend you either try a different cuisine or come over to my place! "," Do my eyes deceive me? Is there legit barbecue in Pittsburgh?! 

Going to Yinzburgh is so much easier than driving down to Georgia when you're craving good bbq. Try the pulled pork, try the ribs, try the bbq burritos! I love gorging on this restaurant's food. 

Yinzburgh is truly an oddity in Oakland. Pierogies are fine, so is pizza, but where in this state can you find proper barbecue? Yinzburgh, that's where. "," The flavors and hospitality were absolutely amazing. The only reason they did not get five stars, was  the temperature of the food. The meat came out at just above room temp and the sauce was cold. "," In line with the other reviews, the owners here are fantastic.  The woman behind the counter walked me through their process and got me to sample all the sauces.  The second time back she wanted me to try out a new dish they had just put on the menu.

I can only speak to their chicken, but it is fantastic.  The meat just falls off the bone and the sauces really compliment the dry rub.  I tried the extra spicy and the honey mustard -- both are great.

The quiche crust has a sweetness, so if you're into savory / sweet combos. The quality of eggs and spinach used is up there. The ricotta pancakes were so good, I think its in the batter, who knows ? I've got a breakfast spot in Pittsburgh :=) "," This place was a nice find on the strip. We ducked in not expecting much, but ended up having a delicious breakfast for a reasonable price. I had the special, which consisted of fried eggs atop a bbq beef hash. The bbq was flavorful, with a spicy kick at the end that had me finishing my plate in record time. The coffee was also pretty good, and the free refills were a nice added bonus. I'm looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in Pittsburgh, and seeing what else their menu has to offer!

It took so long to get our drinks that we had them for only a few minutes before we got the call our table was ready and had to leave. We were looking at a 45 minute wait! It probably took almost half an hour for 4 drinks to arrive, 3 of which were the same.

The drink I had (Friday night special) was absolutely delicious but the slow service hindered the enjoyment of the beverage.",Orgasmically delicious pulled pork eggs benny & great friendly sevice. What more can a gal ask for at brunch?," Great new restaurant. Love the fresh baked muffins, cheesy omelette, home fries, and Mac 'n cheese. The food is similar to School in liberty village and doesn't disappoint. Patio is really nice and shaded. Only been here twice at off hours but was still Surprised this place wasn't busier. Given the quality of food and service, I'd expect it to be packed any time of day! ","I don't usually give a 3 but it deserves it, place looked big on the outside but the sitting area was small, as well as the bar. Food was below average; ordered the Porky Pork Waffle, and my fiancÃ©e ordered the Hogtown BBQ Benny. Presentation was nice, taste was good, but when it arrived to our table it was warm, as if it was sitting under the lamp. I thought that the service was fine, servers were proactive but our cup was empty most of the time until we called them.

Worth a try, sure."," place was nice and cute, came here on a tuesday morning and there was almost no one with was nice. the waiter was very nice. ordered the blueberry hill pancakes. very filling, wasn't able to finish because there was so much but it was too sweet for me and i just did not like it. eating something that sweet in the morning did not make me feel great. i'm sure the other things on their menu are better but sadly i will not be coming back for more. "," Had the daily special of Chicken,waffle,and poached egg. My husband had the pancakes with the bananas. The brunch meal was meh, not amazing like at other places.

I understand saving money but nobody would want the butt of the bread, consider your guests. They always have extremely slow service inside too. :("," This restaurant's staff is undertrained and there are mistakes on one out of every two orders.

Server came and took drink orders.  We had 3 shareable apps, pretzel sticks had no salt, looked like they had blisters and were dripping in oil, beer sauce was nice.  Egg rolls were nice too.  I had beef tips on garlic mash with stout gravy.  Was just warm, beef way over cooked and chewy, raw mushrooms which was odd.  Johan had a beef and brisket burger which was dry and paid extra for garlic fries, it was just fries with a plop of garlic on a few fries.

It will now be a regular stop on our restaurant list. Thanks for the exceptional service and the great food. "," Ok, I'm not from the South, I'm not a BBQ connoisseur BUT I've eaten enough good BBQ to know what a beef brisket sandwich is supposed to taste like.  What I had at Famous Dave's earlier this afternoon was NOT BBQ.  It was thawed meat that tasted like Little League hot dogs and with absolutely no BBQ sauce.  Honestly, the best part of my meal was the bread.  Yeah, that's what I came for...the bread.  Do yourself a favor and skip Famous Dave's.

If this is a franchised operation than the quality control is really lacking.  Our first visit to Capriotti's and with so many other quality places I doubt if they will get us as repeat customers.  Well, here it is.  We ordered the Bobbie and the Capastrami shared it.  Both had cold bread in fact we got the impression that both sandwiches had been pre made and put in a refrigerator because the insides were also cold.  No taste at all in either.  For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits.  Will not return "," This place is always good, I think the owner actually made my sandwich last time I was there , owner or manager, anyway it was superb! quite flavorful, even the next day it tasted just as good. Grab a Capistrami you can't go wrong, until next time Cappie's , be well. "," one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...

In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go. ","#1 in Vegas for a reason.  Everyone has their favs.... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush...  Mine is definitely the Bobby.  In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich... yeah, exactly.","Worst service I have seen at a capriotti's. Ordered a sandwich, watched the guy write it down and 25 minutes later the same person asked what I wanted when I reminded him of my sandwich, he only said he can't remember where the order went.

I thought it was good but it wasn't life changing or anything. The only reason we decided to check it out was because they're open late. "," After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this place a shot, especially cause I was craving soup. The seafood soup is very spicy and delicious. If you order take out/delivery the seafood broth comes in a separate bowl and you can add as much of it to the noodle as you like.  The sweet and sour chicken was just alright, nothing special to note. The pad thai has a generous amount of chicken and shrimp and tastes great. I got free coupons for Spring Rolls, and Roti with curry sauce for my next visit. "," Today was a lazy Sunday for me.. so I decided to order delivery. I've ordered the Thai fried fish cake, I find it lacking in flavour. 

I was craving for curry fish balls, the curry was not bad but the curry was a bit thick. 

The fried tofu was very tasty. Just enough flavour and it was crunchy. I really enjoyed this.

I've also ordered the Tom yum noodles, it was okay as the soup lacked the spice. 

I will definitely come back for the tofu and the iced tea! ","Since the only other pho restaurant is pho 88 by empress, the food here is decent. However, service is lacking. I suppose you don't go to these places for service, but because of the other options around, I will not go back just for the average food."," OK place for a bowl of pho in the Finch area.

Not a fan - they were not careful at all and my cuticles were mangled after this. I live down town so cheap nail places aren't hard to find and the one near me takes their time for the same price. These girls were not the kindest to my friend or I even when we tried making polite conversation and left great tips. Language barriers aside - a smile is pretty universal...so is being all rammy-jammy with sharp nail tools...

Na thanks. Not sure what the raves are about but I will be sticking to my own place now. ","This really is an awesome nail salon.  It is spotlessly clean (including the bathroom!), very chic-ly decorated, and has some of the loveliest ladies around.  I came here for a after-hours mani/pedi party with a group of friends, and we had a blast.  Nailsense had Pretty Woman on their large flat screen while we ate, drank, and were buffed and polished to perfection.  And the cost?  A mani/pedi here is $35.  Yep, you read that right.  35 BUCKS!  A complete steal for the level of service.

DEFINITELY will be back!","3.5/5
ok i think i had much higher expectations of this place b/c of the reviews
my sister & i came 4 pedicures and she got shellac mani as well. they sat us side by side which was nice, the place was packed - which it seems like it always is
there are tons and tons of colours to pick out, which is nice
regular pedicure but my sister said they went to town with her cuticles for her manicure that it actually hurt
the place is really nice and clean and i want to give it another chance when im in the area for shellac mani myself"," I have been to Nailsense several times, for waxing and manicure. A great salon with great prices.

*Waxing: Both Kim and Thuy are excellent and provide useful advice throughout the process... I won't say they make it painless but they make it as pleasant as waxing can be! And the place is very clean. I won't go anywhere else for my waxing!

Kim is also amazing for manicures, I had the gel nails done a few months ago and everyone at work kept asking me where I had them done! "," They do not do fake nails, of any kind. So if you need a fill don't bother. The website is deceiving, it allows you to pick the option of a gel set. I picked that option, and then good thing that I called before I went to ask the price or I would have gone all the way there for nothing! take that option off your website! apparently its been over a year since you offered gel nails! Disappointed... "," Always have a great experience here.  I was an hour late to my last waxing appt due to unforeseen circumstances--they still fit me in and were very nice about it.  
The staff are very nice and I'm always impressed with the results. ","This place is excellent to get your waxing or manicure done.
Starting coming here to get my waxing done by Thuy, she is very professional and gentle.
Then recently started getting mani-pedis. I got shellac nails done by Kim, she did an excellent job, my nails didnt chip for nearly 3 weeks! 
Overall, I highly recommend this place. 
Its clean, workers are professional and the prices are acceptable! Much cheaper then some over-hyped downtown places with less professional people","The staff are sometimes in a rush and therefore are not always careful - cutting cuticles too short and not providing a very relaxing experience.

She was not very helpful and our food came 45 min later cold! The general manager was very nice very helpful," Came here for an event that was supposed to be four hours long, we all left after one. The best part of this bar was the DJ that we hired. The staff was extremely condescending and rude.

She threatened to kick me out. Don't waste your time or money ","Good layout, friendly staff, and excellent waffle fries. The place didn't get jumping until almost midnight. The ratio of men to women was terrible, about 75/25 percent so if you're a single guy, be aware. Maybe I came on a bad night.",Terrible service - messed our order up three times.  Philly sliders were cold.  Nachos have squeeze cheese and cold chicken.  Can't understand why they can't deliver on such a tiny menu if simple bar food.

We took advantage of their special offer which was $100 per person guaranteed you a seat and all the premium drinks you wanted!  The manager was so wonderful as was our very  accommodating and friendly waitress/bartender Liz.  We hardly drank!  But we could if we had wanted to!  The other people that came to watch the games were very nice too, even if they were for the other teams. The food was really good, too.  All in all, a great experience!","This is one of those places that tries so hard to be an edgy ""dive"" bar but fails on all levels. The hostess was horrible at her job and the wait staff weren't much better. The food is terrible and the free drink was more like a half drink.

I ended up having the corned beef sandwich since I didn't get one for St. Patty's day last month. It was very good except for the slightly soggy bottom piece of bread. I could still hold it though...just a little messy. ",I've spent a good deal of time in Robbie's bar and restaurant and have always been impressed by their food and the friendliness of their staff.  We love the patio for lunch and every now and then swing by for the after dinner hours when things get exciting.  Robbie himself spends a good deal of time there and has no end of amusing stories.  Just one of my favorite places in Tempe," A fun place to hang out, the food is good and the people are fun! ",Best Corned beef sandwich on rye w/ chips and a slight add of Colman's Mustard....  Fantastic!," Visited during a Thursday Happy Hour.  The place was virtually deserted, and after ordering the ""Tavern Steak"" I think I know why.  Hopefully, all of their entrees aren't this bad.  If I owned a restaurant I would be ashamed and  embarrassed to put out  this lousy of a product.  The service was woeful as well. "," I normally go to Rula Bula on Mill ave. A friend of mine told me about Robbie Fox's, and knowing how much i enjoy a good pub I had to give it a try. Not only was the food exceptional (a great burger), but the atmosphere was welcoming, the server at my table was very attractive, conscientious, and attentive to my needs (not to mention the sexy european accent). Price wise the food and drink is worth every penny. Definitely my newest haunt. ",It is a great place with great crowd and good service. If you are on mill this is the only place you should go. Avoid all the other bars," Well the down town Tempe location is great of course. The staff was great and I guess they just changed ownership. The menu was small the food was just so so. I had the shepherds pie , it was ok not bad. Wife had the corn beer and cabbage, the corn beer was like a steak not that tender.  We also had the corn dog sasusage which didnt look appetizing. It did taste better than it looked. Was kinda dark as I also seen the fish and chips that looked dark on the breading.  The people were great beer was cold.  They need to work on the food and menu.

I'll definitely go back.,"The food was a hit this time unlike last time I was here. Although the salad could improve a bit. The croutons in the Caesar salad were huge and since you can't really cut croutons I didn't eat them. The Pad Thai with shrimps was excellent. The calamari, although greesy, was very tasty. If you become a vVVIP member you get a $10 discount. The service was much better this time, maybe because we were seated inside and not in the patio.","Ok - for the food at Jack Astors is good but it is not 4 stars by my rating scale!  What gets this location to 4 stars overall is the roof top patio!

Today I took two of my men tees for lunch and we grabbed a beer under the sun! Being 4 or 5 stories above Yonge street was great and this patio is huge!

Great patio and view on a summer day with mist and shade on the rooftop. I like their new drink menu but since they changed their food menu, I haven't been a fan. So it's usual if opt out of food and just settle for drinks.","Overpriced everything, low quality food. Save your money and go down the road to Nome, It's more luxurious and cost less. You would have to be foolish to pay $20+ for a burger, when Hero burgers is a quarter the price and down the road. Really not worth it, No offence."," Jack Astor's (this location) is hands down my favourite rooftop patio in North York. Food is alright, service is alright, price range is similar to restaurants like milestones and sharks. If quality dining experience (food wise) is what you're looking for I wouldn't recommend but definitely for drinks and hanging out with a decent view. 
Location is pretty convenient - near the TTC station and they have street parking available.
P.s. Recommend their Chicken quesadillas, Veggie pizza, the fishbowl cocktails. (Avoid their shrimp pasta - watery, Calamari - a bit greasy)  
Overall, good experience! ",Really liked coming here! It was my first time and the food was amazing! The service was good and the atmosphere was great. It's definitely on the loud side and very casual. I had the chicken poutine and it was to die for. My boyfriend has the sirloin burger with pulled pork on it (big Texas burger I think?) and it was amazing. I had to have a second giant bite of it. Come here with friends for drinks for sure.,"The atmosphere inside is a bit loud, but the  large rooftop patio is a nice option. The service is decent, but you'll probably get quicker service if you're seated inside. Things are a bit pricey here but they do offer a VIP membership that can save you some money.

065c76tt1dXBNmoGBymUgQ,I enjoyed my Chili Cheese dog. The meat in the chili was just spicy enough for my taste. The staff was great and pleasant even on a busy day. The food is a little pricey for a hot dog but worth it!,This is one of the best things I've ever ate.  It's located in Container Park- Downtown Las Vegas.  It's not your traditional hotdog.  The Chef deserves a handshake for sure!!!!  Awesome..," Awwwww, no chilli dogs til Fri, Sat, Sunday!  I really wanted that chilli dog!  Also the beer I like it's seasonal, so I will have to return in the fall for the brew I like.  But it was a good experience.  I tried the crunchy dog.  It was different.....Since they didn't have the chilli dog, I was forced to try something else.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but you know when your mouth is watering for what you want, and it's not available......... yea!   Service was good, and quick. No issues with that.  I will be back on a Fri, Sat or Sunday for a chilli dog! "," High quality gourmet hot dogs. Kind of pricey and a long wait time for hot dogs, but definitely something different. El Mexicano and the Grand Father dog are excellent choices ","Hipster little joint here. The menu is pretty straight forward and they have some unique selections for hot dogs. We had hot dogs, the cheeseburger, and chicken fingers (for the kids). I personally had El Mexicano and it was super tasty, but $7 for a single hot dog is a little bit ridiculous. The kids didn't like the chicken fingers and the burger was just bad. Customer service was not great either. The cashier had a little of an attitude problem taking our ""complex"" order."," Too many good options! I love hot dogs and this place had some of the best toppings I've ever seen... Rivaling my own home creations.

Quail egg? Yum. Seaweed? How did I not think of that before?

We grabbed a beer as well and sat in the outdoor deck space. This whole container park is pretty adorable and wholesome... Especially when you stop to realize you're in Vegas.

Overall, this spot is approachable and also hip... Much like a hot dog with a quail egg on it. ",I ordered the El Mexicano and the Cheffini's dogs and both were great. The Mexicano had a green cilantro sauce on top that was perfectly tangy with a lot of flavor. And the crunch of the bacon wrapped around the hot dog was a great texture change. The Cheffini's dog had a sweet and savory combo that worked great together and that little bits of chips was a delicious surprise.,"Went here at 10 pm. They close at 11. I wanted to other fries and dude working said no. Unless I were to ""too him a few dollars"" to turn the fryer back on. Horrible customer service dude was a chode. Won't be visiting again.","If you're in the mood for a hot dog and are looking for something a bit nicer than a normal dog this is the place to go.

The filet was thinner than expected, but cooked as ordered and delicious. The cervichi appetizer was also fabulous. The service was very good, there was a slight wait to be acknowledged, but once we were, food orders were quick and staff very friendly.  The only downside was the size of my cocktail, though made with fresh ingredients and well executed, for a $9-10 drink, it was small!

Yes they're a seafood restaurant but offer other options and have a gluten free menu. They're owned under Outback Steakhouse so the food is guaranteed delicious","This restaurant is a good casual restaurant, it may not be the best restaurant in town but it's far from the worst. The food always comes out well prepared, and is made with fresh high quality ingredients, but the staff can be a bit inattentive.

We asked for 1 inch of hair all around and when we got him back he had been cut so that very little hair remained. We maintain our dogs hair by brushing him every single day because we like long hair. Not only they did cut him too short but they cut a huge chunk out of his neck! The haircut is not even.

The saunas I don't really care for, but that's because I felt like a roasting potato.

Unfortunately, they raised the day pass price to $55 but it's worth it to go at least once."," This spa is amazing. I go to Vegas often and I look forward to this spa almost as much as the trip. The atmosphere is relaxing. When I leave there I feel like I was rejuvenated from head to toe.
The steam room and roman baths are amazing. I can find myself there for hours and hour just relaxing on the heated lounge chairs by the Roman baths. 
There are snack, tea, water and juices available. There is every thing you can think of to get ready after your experience. No need to bring hair brushes or curling/straighteners they have them!
Absolutely, love this place. Wish I lived closer I'd be a frequent visitor! "," Pricey, but worth it.   Fridays and Saturdays can get busy, which may disturb some as there is quite a bit of talking.   The ice room is my favorite retreat in here, make sure you check it out. "," The spa is beautiful!  The service was a bit spotty.  My masseuse was amazing.  I had just been in a rear end collision and she was able to work all of my knots out.  Feeling much better now.  I would definitely recommend their dry sauna, you know how some sauna's are just too hot, well this one I must say was just perfect.  Avoid the chill room.  It's not snowflakes coming out of the ceiling, it's soap.  It's just kinda uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.  Oh - I don't mind being cold, like I love the cold plunge, the chill room just didn't float my boat. "," I got a day pass for this spa and it was a wonderful experience, especially right before I had to take a long red eye flight home! I was so relaxed. Loved the heated beds as well as the hot/cold baths. The Arctic room was great as well, and the shower facilities and amenities were all one could ask for! The showers had Vichy sprayers which was a pleasant surprise and bonus! The day pass is a great deal and the best on the strip! If you want to relax, this is the place to go! ",We stayed at Wynn but decided to visit the SPA in Caesars Palace based on positive reviews. It didn't fail us. Massages come with access to the bath. A must go in Vegas!,"The next time you're looking to unwind and want to visit a spa this is a great option. The place is a bit pricey, but completely worth every dollar. The decor of the place is luxurious and beautiful. The staff is also very accommodating and they work hard to make sure that everyone feels comfortable all the time.

I'm picky about my seafood since I used to live in the Bay Area and know what fresh good sushi should taste like. 

Everything was tasty and the Tuna was nice and firm just the way I like it. I will be ordering from this place again for sure. It's #3 on my list with Spicy Tuna being #2 and Osaka being at the top.

We came here for our friends birthday and the owner came out spoke with us.  Very nice and inviting.  She even gave my friend a present and gave us a chef's special dish. 

We will come back here again, if just for the excellent service. ","We had dinner at Sai for the first time tonight. We had the AYCE sushi. Every roll was delicious! (There was very very minimal wait time in between ordering rolls.) The service was fantastic! Our waiter, Juan, was attentive, friendly, and made fantastic suggestions when we were ordering.

It's got a dive atmosphere, but in a classy way - a way that won't leave you wanting to put on a pair of latex gloves before touching anything. The walls are covered in velvet. And well, it's just an awesome decor and atmosphere. Granted, yes, it is really smokey, but that just adds to the dive ambiance IMHO. They don't serve food. The beer is good.

We ordered chicken BBQ hot wings and the order took forever, but when it finally arrived it was sooo good, probably one of the best wings i've ever had. So worth the wait, but... the service sucked. The waitress was so blah she couldn't care any less. The same people at the host stand, they were just uninviting. 
Food was really good but i wouldn't go back, too snobby for Vegas, way too many places around there to eat at. Wouldn't go back. ","Horrible service, mediocre food.

Service: very friendly and you can see they are passionate in customer and in their work. 

Food: we only sample the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. It is on point. 

Drinks: they use Pilot Coffee Roasters Blend. I quite enjoy the Cortado. Since they are still soft opening, they are adjusting the taste. Hope they can work on the crema. It is still a better espresso drink in Markham. 

I am sure will come back to try their brunch items and home baked goods. ","The worst experience ever in Toronto. Waited for more than 15 mins with no one coming help us. Went to ask for seats, the waiter was so rude saying"" I already told ur friend (which he didn't) why u still asking? It's selfserve. Go serve urself!""
Literally WTF. It's a small restaurant which I understand and not expecting much customer service from them. But this is way too much.

What can I say, the place fills up quickly. Open face omelette pork belly my wife says its like Filipino style and was impressed. Had a hot mocha with the breakfast. The side salad matched well.

I wasn't a huge fan of the Pita bread, but that's my ONLY complaint ","The place is clean and the servers are nice. 

The food was a little lacking in flavor. We had Chicken kaabob, kefta, fries and rice. The chicken was good, needed more marination. The kefta was boring and the rice was horrible, old and dry. The garlic spread they use with the chicken is awesome and very very strong garlic. 

I used the yelp deal but the meal only can to $22 so I have a yelp deal to go back. I just am not sure I will.

on most nights so pretend it's a NYC place. We made reservations as I strongly recommend for anyone dining.  My favorite was the farfalle pasta with pistachios, shrimp and saffron. The app of Brussels sprouts and parsnip purÃ©e pizza was incredible my delicious. I have found a new favorite dinner destination. ",Great food! Very cute restaurant. It is a little loud when the main room is full but the pizza was delicious.,Food was good but portions are really small for the price. Wine is overpriced.   Bring your wallet.,Grilled octopus is soft and tasty. However it has a rather strong fishy smell. The spaghetti with shrimp dish is excellent. The pasta is fresh and cooked perfectly al dente. The brick oven pizza with prosciutto and brussel sprouts are delicious!," Awful. The noise level is deafening. Right after the four of us paid paid several hundred dollars for dinner, we were asked to vacate our table because someone else was waiting for it. Wait, what?! None of us will ever go there again nor will we recommend it. Too bad because one of the group is on the board of a large public company HQ in Charlotte. Stagioni won't get a second chance to make a good first impression. ",LOVE this place! Tried a little of everything from appetizers to desert and it was flawless. Lovely atmosphere; highly recommend for a group dinner or date night.," First of all this could be literally the only restaraunt in NC that serves zucchini flowers... For this reason alone I showed up and Stagoni did NOT disaapoint. LIGHT, DELICATE, FLAVORFUL!! Anyone can make squash blossoms them but these were fabulous! The mussles? So good we ordered them twice. I am a very picky Italian and everything we had we enjoyed! ","We had two apps, $13.00 for 3 pork meatballs and $15.00 for a fig tart that was to sweet that it should have been a dessert rather than an app. Place is way expensive for Italian food. The wine menu again is very expensive for the selection, same glass of pinto at wolfgangs is $3.00 less cheaper. Glad we tried it but you pay for the Myers Park area instead of quantity and quality of the food.","This is a good place to stop by if you are looking for a family dinner environment. The main dining room can be a bit loud with kids, but that's something that is encouraged by the restaurant to try to make it have a family friendly environment. The food always comes out perfect though, they always make everything fresh and it shows. The pricing is also a little high for the size, but the quality is there.",562PgsOzKdneLoUqcgMXIQ,2Bdbj3pi0uH9cYA1F35KTg,J0OqAJw39iC_5_1_Os6CUw,LKKLZ5cckLXz8BTYWfhVLw,T0a3YgQY5cJziGN-o2SzpA,S4c5D-doPQjws5qYi5pYtw,x8pUBoNhBuNvzWU8QcwT0w,us_hw-q2ZcYdYc96AtWgxA

However we will always ignore the not great service and go here to eat because the food is soo good. Order the shredded pork pan fried noodles and the crispy roast pork.,"Their beef has gone bad. It looked light as pork. - June 6, 2016

You could say their beef's got beef with my small intestine. Been in the restroom all day. Good god! Health inspection, please. Beef is spoiled! Don't order the beef or you'll be in pain like me.",good food except for steamed seabass. youll know if it frozen and not worth the price. yang chow was superb amd the generals chicken. beef broccoli was also tasty and flavorful. will definetely comeback but will avoid the steamed fish coz its not fresh,yes the food is incredibly authentic chinese but it has been discovered and now extremely busy. come early to avoid the madness and crowds.,Dont know how good the food is but if Ive been standing by the door more than 15' and no one greets?!! Not even a hello and ask how many people??,Horrible service. I waited for 10 minutes in an empty restaurant waiting for the hostess to set me. They couldn't pause the their conversation for a minute to just nod and point me to a seat.,"As soon as I walked in, all 3 waitresses turned their backs and headed to talk among themselves in the back. After having stood by the door for a good minute, one of the waitress motioned me to a table. Didn't hand me a menu or asked what I wanted to drink. Right then, a Chinese (?) couple came in. They were greeted warmly and escorted to their tables. I'm Filipino by the way. 3 more minutes of waiting and nobody came to take my order. I just left..."," If you need a place to get the freshest and most authentic Chinese food in town, Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe is the place to go. Whether you are craving peking duck, lobster, or even freshwater eel, this restaurant will definitely fulfill your cravings. Whenever I go here, I get THE freshest seafood and I am never disappointed with their dishes. There was this AMAZING waitress here that was able to provide me with extraordinary service and a welcoming atmosphere. I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants here in Vegas and nothing compares to Hong Kong Garden. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place with fresh and authentic Chinese food!","I don't know where to start. It's authentic, yeah, but their ingredients might not be the best quality. Service is lackluster. Seems the waitresses are too busy talking to themselves, and are too busy gossiping to pay attention to what's going on around them.  It's pure chaos when it's busy, so check it out when it's not.

The house is amazing 
It actually a converted house! So freakin cool "," Visiting from Berkeley and love the ambiance here, nice old school vibe and super friendly waitress. Ordered a veggie omelette with bacon on the side, with a salad. 

Super fresh and came out fast. Had a great conversation with my friend Neil and loved the experience here. A must visit brunch place in toronto, one of my new favorites! ","The food isnt worth the horrible service. 

Rude aggressive staff. Told us to wait outside in a -10 weather in a rude tone:""you have to wait outside, okay? "" while he shoved me with his hands. Keep your hands to yourself. 

We left at a heatbeat and we're never going back."," Love love love. The potato salad is awesome. So far I've tried the breakfast pocket and the breakfast tacos and both left me feeling very satisfied. The sidewalk patio is great in the summer. Prices are reasonable, service has always been good and I've never had to wait for a table (both times I've gone at breakfast on a weekday). My waiter today was a riot. "," For the price, this place ain't a bad brunch option. The scrambled eggs weren't half bad. The OJ was nice. I'de say you're going here more for folksy atmosphere than the food.

Their omelette topping choices are not exactly varied. Their featured omelette for the day I went had cauliflower in it. cauliflower?

if you want a killer brunch, hoof cafe is my pick. nobody in the city does pig like those guys. "," i really like this place. Its always really busy though and not big enough to accommodate the high demand, which means they could raise their prices, but they don't, which is nice. Good food, friendly staff, well priced. More places in toronto should be like this. ",Delicious grilled cheese - I had the Brie and Pear one and it was a rich mix of sweet and savoury (salty) that paired nicely with potato salad that had a more light taste.,"Nice ambiance and atmosphere. Relaxing place and service is top notch. The food is also very good. The place can get a little busy though so a lot of rushing around for the staff, but they keep their cool.

Food is Ok. You can try once.
You will not find smile on the Owners Face.
No cooler hot like hell.
Not Clean to expected standards.
Inexpensive food. 
restaurant is crammed. ",Oh my goodness yummy chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. SO HAPPY to see a good Indian place on this side of town. I think businesses come and go in the shopping center these guys are in though so eat there! So I can continue to eat there. :)," food here is average with poor quality
for example paneer butter masala was lime water with no paneer and few onions
and place is not very hygenic
the owner took order from folks and took payments written something on paper for phone order cleaned tables and he went to kitchen put masala stuff on the dosa with bare hands and rolled dosa with bare left and right hand. come on atleast use plastic gloves it so gross
not going again ","should be rated as 0.  worst place to eat in phoenix. worst indian food. raw and uncooked. stinking meat. rotten meat served. will cause food poisoning.  never eat in this place. if you eat, eat at your own risk."," The food isn't always fresh, but when it is, it is okay. The portions aren't that great. But the worst thing is the customer service. I was getting food to go and asked for a napkin, the woman said ""we are out of napkins"". I just looked at her in disbelief. She sighed, turned around and went into the back. Returned with a new pack of napkins, opened them in front of my eyes and handed me a couple. Nice. ",Found a replacement place for Biryani very near to this restaurant opened Pastries N Chaat which serves alot better food than Bawarchi atleast he wont lie saying Biryani is fresh and serve stale food....,"The food is mostly pretty good. Not a place to dine in. Small stuffy and hot, with the hot oil & burners in close vicinity to the seats. The biryani & chicken curry are good. Paneer mattar (ie., cheese with peas) is a waste, you get 3 pieces of paneer floating in curry or 4 if you're lucky. Being in Scottsdale, decent Indian food is hard to come by. So this little hole in the wall stands out! It is on the spicy side, which is great if you like that. The big plus is... they recently opened an Indian grocery store next door. They have a good variety of spices, daals etc.","This place really isn't that great.  The atmosphere could be so much better.  The restaurant is pretty small and hot, so its really annoying when there are a lot of people.  It just makes me feel uncomfortable.  The food is average at its very best.  At its worst, you get chicken that is old, with sauce that is watered down and flavorless.

We felt like that was the most unsanitary thing anyone could do - he could have just come from the restroom for all we knew.  Needless to say, lackluster service, mediocre food and lack of concern for the cleanliness of the food prep area will guarantee we will NEVER return."," We like the food and prices are reasonable. Our biggest complaint is the service. It took a bit long to get a server to come over and then it took our server a while to get our bread and drinks. They really need to develop a better sense of teamwork.  While waiting for things there were numerous servers standing around gabbing. It really gave us the impression of ""Not my table."" ""Not my problem."" Only other complaint is they need to get some rinse aid for the dishwasher. I had to dry our bread plates when the hostess gave them to us. "," Not enough staff is on hand the two times I have been in to properly pay attention to paying customers. I agree that the portions have shrunk over the years, and the effort is no longer there. It is convenient to have nearby but not worth my time when other great restaurants are around. Wish I could rate it better but it's just not that good at all. ","Went to dinner with 4 others and had another bad experience at the Macaroni Grill.  When will we ever learn?  The server was not only inattentive, but p o'd when we asked to be moved to another table.  When the food came it was at best, luke warm.  They had run out of one of our ordered dishes, but didn't inform us until 20 minutes after we had ordered.  Running out at 6:00 p.m.: Really? More delay and no apologies. There is no excuse for a cold meal and poor service.  We will not go back since the Grill seems not to care and there are plenty of other restaurants which do."," The service is kind and friendly. 

However there was complementary bread served.

The Pizza I ordered was undercooked and had very little sauce.

Macaroni Grill has unfortunately taken a dive.  Best to avoid the place or at the very least this location. ","I know this is a chain, but Between this and Olive Garden, I would def pick this place. Service was great at this location and food not bad at all, although not excellent, I think it still deserves a good 4 stars","I had a  2 for 1 $9.00 express dinner coupon so we order up 2 dinners to go. The deal was 9 min or its free, it took 20, but since I was getting 2 meals for $9.00 I did not make a fuss. 

 The actual pasta was fine and amount was fair but it  had maybe a 1/4 of a chicken breast. The chicken tasted like it came from Taco Bell, VERY processed. The sauce straight from a can.

 I have had much better frozen dinners. My husband and I used to like Macaroni Grill it sad too see its food go so down hill.","The atmosphere was great, friendly server. Although the food I think is served from frozen. I ordered mama trio. The two of three items were great. Plate came out hot, couldn't touch it. Went to eat lasagna and was ice cold in the center, nit even warm. 
The server apologized about it offered new one or reheat this one. I chose a new one to go. I saw her go tell manager. The manager didn't even come over and say anything. I was not even acknowledged on my way out and walked past 3 people. I will not be going back. Over priced for frozen food.","I'm really not a fan of Macaroni Grill, well, at least THIS Macaroni Grill.  The staff is slow and really doesn't seem to car about providing quality service.  It took well over 30 minutes to get my food and the place wasn't even packed with people.  I ordered pizza and it didn't taste right.  I think it wasn't fully cooked.

It's shredded and has a nice kick to it.," Fantastic!  Went there with my boyfriend and some friends for drinks and a bite.  I got a veggie burrito (definitely a thumbs up) and an assortment of drinks, all delicious.  You can tell the bartender cares about what he puts together, and it was fun chatting with him before we ate.  The atmosphere is almost trying too hard, but that really only adds to it's charm, as you notice more and more interesting details as you look around (parachute frogs on the vent, etc).  I'm hoping to stop in again very soon to try their veggie nachos or tacos. ",Great happy hour beer special with friendly bartenders.  This is a good place to start and end the night.  There food is decent (gringo Mex) as well and I like the Mexican out door atmosphere feel.,Bangin' tacos served all night long. Perfect for when you stumble in at 1:45 am all famished and looking for something tasty just before you head home.,"Best reverse happy hour in Tempe. 4 stars is only for the bar -- not the food as my liver was in charge that night. Chronic Tacos is one of those places where things can go downhill quickly - but all in fun and cheap drinks. The $3 rockstar/vodkas were our poisons of choice. Busy, but not crowded Chronic at 9-ish was fun and likeable wih their comfortable black leather booths.

Our happy hour last week that turned into a reverse happy hour resulting in free acrobatic entertainment by yours truly on the light rail. At Chronic Tacos, just remember: buyer beware."," Four reasons I come here: it's downstairs from where I work, they have decent prices, the bartender makes a pretty good margarita and I like the patio.

Not a huge fan of their food and in the summertime when the windows are closed it kinda stinks when you first walk in, but overall it's a good place for drinks on a patio-type day on Mill.",Great place to go for entertainment and to hang out with friends.

",SLOW last 2 times I have been here. Today was 50 minute wait and last time was 55 minutes. It seems the problem is before the wash because not many cars in line after the wash but way backed up before the wash.," Pathetic car wash. If you want good service, value for your money go to another car wash. They left patches of dirt on the tires, body and on the bumper. Even after complaining to the so called ""Manager"", nothing happened. I paid for the VIP car wash. Left disappointed. Will never go back. Stay away from this car wash. ","It is always hard to review Danny's. They wash your car for $12 bucks but you always want them to do more. 

They vacuum, wash, dust, do windows, tires and dry your car every time. Usually in less then 45min. TOTALLY worth the money. 

Sure they miss the air freshener or a window or a floor mat you paid extra to have cleaned.... still better then I do on my own. I would spend hours cleaning for almost the same results.

We sat at the bar, with maybe 10 customers in the whole restaurant and a good amount of servers. About 10 min to be asked if I wanted a drink. When the bill came. We promptly paid it and waited forever for the bartender to finish arraigning bottles and putzing around before finally taking out payment."," Honesty, nothing special about the burgers. I was expecting a burger experience.  All I got was an average patty with decent topping. Actually the patty wasn't great. Didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.

"," The appetizers are plentiful, the burger choices are amazing, the non burger options are fantastic, and there is even dessert! So many beers to choose from..what's a girl to do? The service is great, fast and friendly! You can have a spicy burger or a sweet burger on a glazed donut!

I could understand a random night during the week but not sure what the excuse is for a Saturday.  They also didn't bring out the appetizer until after we received our food.  The food is good though and the service staff appeared to be solid.","This place has the best burgers, period. Not only that but they have so many different choices as far as what kind of burger you want, its insane. The also have some amazing non burger choices too if your in the mood.

Came with 2 baskets of whole  wheat pitas which were warm and soft :) We each had  different entrees ;  Grilled calamari salad ( calamari was grilled perfectly), small lamb souvlaki dinner, large pork  souvlaki dinner,  and a salmon dinner  -- all came with a starter greek salad and rice, potatoes, and mixed veg. 

Will definitely  come back!","This is a huge restaurant; it has 2 separate patios and a ton of indoor seating. I've come here on many separate occasions in the past, and while it hasn't disappointed me, I can't say I've ever been wow-ed. I had the small pork souvlaki dinner with rice and roasted potatoes ($14.95). The portion sizes are good and the tzatziki is super garlicky (I do love garlic). The potatoes they gave me (3) were also huge!! So, I left very full (and feeling like I undid my workout just before)."," Love the great comfort food this place offers, they also have a fab patio in the summer! "," This place definitely has problems with consistency, but it has remained one of my favourite places on the danforth. I usually only go there for take-out, electing to go to pantheon when I want to get a table. At one point the grill men were actually greeks (maybe a greek guy still pulls an occasional shift) but that seems like it was ages ago.

In any case, the lamb sandwich on a bun with extra tzatziki is my pick, although sometimes the chunks of lamb are just too fatty and make for a chewing struggle. Depends on the day. Oh yeah, and be prepared for onion breath. Those are raw onions :) ",I was in here today November the 7th  we ordered few things I'm surprised how terrible it is the quality it's not there like they used to be the best on the Danforth when some Greek American had purchased the place since he sold it n the knew  guys picked it up its not the same terrible The management should wake up and smell the coffee and  not to get greedy  the most recent operator looks like a lost farmer ....!!!!," This is the best Greek restaurant on the Danforth- Greek Town!

You can't really go wrong with any of the Greek restaurants in this area - we have tried just about all of them over the years, but if you want the best one, Astoria is it.
Patio if great. Service always fantastic.  One litre bottles of wine: great. It probably has the largest seating capacity in the area so getting is usually not a problem. Opa! "," This was my favourite restaurant on the Danforth but unfortunately, it no longer is. The prices have increased and the quality of food has decreased. 

Today I ordered their pork souvlaki dinner. The starter salad was too salty to eat and on top of that, the pork was burnt to a crisp. 

Other restaurants on the Danforth will charge the same (some even less) and give you far better quality food. I would only go to Astoria as a last resort from here on in. ",Decent food at a decent price is my tag line for this place.  The portions are generous and the service was friendly.  It seems like this place has been around for a while and you know what you are getting in this family style-ish restaurant.  This won't be the best Greek meal you'll ever have though.  I think it hits the spot but this place seems to be more about the quantity and deriving flavor with lots of cheese & oil as opposed to using the best or fanciest ingredients on the market.  The wine and beer list is also quite limiting.  So just enjoy it for what it is.,"There's some issues here with being consistent all the time, but it's a big place and the service is generally good. The prices have gone up since it first opened and the food quality isn't consistent at all. It's either good, OK, or just bad. You'd expect to pay a lot lower in price for the quality of food they are serving. It's got a good comfort feeling and ambiance to it though.",ggsrfgJkitVIniKAl5yYCw,nT_mF7hSKIDJvTUNhgDVZg,yFSQxL5D3S9T5ApBrRfjJQ,222uztEJKDcruHEECznUqA,g6oCsH4HLOm_vN97XNCgEw,eaU2Ats-um4jmGFuNZCPQQ,ITkuxRk977qRM42Z4KP1YA,5SP8QPLNyevRtAar0OLozg
1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"THE RESTAURANT AT THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. I have eaten here several times - but to my dismay, found it no longer in business at the village trails location. "," Great evening (Oct.) under the stars!  First of all, it's not a French restaurant, rather the chef is French.  They describe themselves as a ""casual American bistro.""  Several of us went and had a great meal!  We shared appetizers: crab cakes, calamari, salmon sushi (special that day), and sweet potato fries.  They all were great (although the fries could have been crispier for me).  We all enjoyed our entrees.  I had the risotto with shrimp and asparagus and found it delicious.  We shared a couple of decadent desserts (made fresh and change daily).  We enjoyed the brownie with apricot pieces and a gelato with chocolate crunchies. "," Great ambiance. Food was very fresh tasting, and all the sandwiches I've had so far are delicious. You won't regret trying this place. Looking forward to trying the dinner menu here. ",They open 7am to 9pm today came and had breakfast at 745... Such a beautiful Labor Day I decided to come have breakfast before heading to red rock... And I wasn't disappointed... Such a lovely cafe in Summerlin... Coffee was great staff very pleasant and welcoming bonini and ham egg quiche was amazing will definitely be coming back,"Really good food IF you stay and get past the way they do NOT greet you!  It's not France--you need to have good customer service!!!  ONLY because my husband is Belgian, we stayed, he's used to bad service.  It's NOT clear when you walk in what to do--sit?  Menus?  Ordering at front and having 3-4 empty/half assed stares by too many people is a Mc Donald's concept,  and uncomfortable.  Especially the blond running the register.  Put her somewhere else, NOT front!  Drip coffee overpriced then $.75 refill?  Mon Dieu!  Again, very good, get your customer service/set up straightened out.  Bonne Chance!!!"," Hidden lunch spot.  This is the perfect lunch setting including indoor outdoor seating. Customers order at the counter, and items are brought to the table. The food is healthy including vegan and gluten free options, but it actually tastes delicious.  The prices are fair and portions generous.  We will definitely be back. ",Very disappointed. Staff needs a better education on what they're serving so they can recommend properly. I'm all for healthy but it has to taste good too. Sweet potato fries were very good but served cold. I cannot recommend this as a lunch spot.,Very cute inside and has potential but unfortunately the salad I ordered was not very fresh and had sliced apples on it and the sticker was still on the fruit!! Ahh that's a big no no for me .... Prolly won't be returning:(,"The chef here is French and works to make a tasty fusion of French and casual American food. The staff can be a little bit inattentive, but that isn't too much of a problem since the food is very good. The decor around the restaurant is very nice and inviting though. I highly recommend checking them out the next time that you are in the mood for some lunch.",avnWx2PINEzYhDVhq2oR7w,AWwLVvHqtgFBgBiqpQuPLw,xOdSgW1yTTqDglfF7k6Nmw,TOaZ67MRnQN_aXvDIulpYw,_OBPQTW62hxRblznc9zHrA,xhp7g4XI0UjZ1IZy4QoBtw,EHGBedgZ1uK0rqr1WG2Igg,n_oHvQgDzRff5pLO3PFIKw

Laid back atmosphere, James Taylor-like live music, and the pulled pork sandwich tasted akin to Blue Ridge Pig BBQ from back East AKA best bbq on the planet earth.  The service was friendly and fast.  Definitely going back. ","My bf and I came here one evening to enjoy the Boom56 gathering and I must say, I really really enjoyed this low key gem!! The spicy cilantro wings BANG!!! Lol...looved them. We sat on the patio and it was cool to people watch all the local neighborhood folk. The DJ played lots of house music which gets me going!! Cant wait to go back in 2 weeks for the next Boom56 set :)","You might really like the squishy, comfortably wide, white barstools at Kitchen 56. I do. The bar straddles the patio and the restaurant, which is good for people watching, too. Although, you might be distracted by some kitchen traffic.

I never find myself saying ""let's go for dinner,"" but definitely, ""let's meet there."" Other restaurants - the Grind is nearby - have menus to brag about. But Kitchen 56 has an open feel, with appreciable curiosities on the walls, and the service has been uniformly engaging.",The food is very sub par at this place and the owners and staff are incredibly rude. I've tried this place out a couple times but when I ended up getting flies in my pizza that was a no go for me. The bartenders drink on the job and it just seems way to pricey for the type of food and service that you get out of this place.,"Kitchen 56 is a great place to stop in during lunch or happy hour. We've had virtually every thing on the menu and the food is always great. They have a fantastic outdoor seating area and will periodically host live music. The restaurant also has a wonderful history. Their downsides are that they redid the menu last year and a lot of our favorites are no longer there, service has been lacking a little lately and they raised their prices (they would've had more stars if it weren't for these things). I guess restaurants think this is something they should automatically do when they are in the Arcadia area.","Probably the 90th time I've been here, but I can't say enough good things about it. This time I just stopped in for a beer, and had a wonderful conversation with Jess, the bartender. She recommended a great beer, and I was once again reminded why I love this place. Just a great place with great food and drinks, and super friendly people."," Food Ok. Subpar service. Found out later that the 'waiter' was the General Manager. Waited over half. An hr for the food, and even later for the check. I. hope this guy doesn't try to cook. He would just drop stuff and leave, like a fly landing on the table, then taking off before you could swat it. He never offered us drinks, and WE had to ask for a desert menus. This place got a lot of hype on check please Arizona, which wasn't earned based on our experience. "," Very limited menu, but the service and food are both good. I just wish there were more options. I was cornered into a salad, which was great, but the bowls are weird and make it hard not to get your lettuce all over your table.","Not the best food in the world, but not the worst either. The atmosphere here is really nice and it's fun. The outdoor seating area is nice too and comfortable. Menu could be bigger, it's a bit limited but again, it's the people and atmosphere here that makes it a nice place to visit.",1Xr8iT2SMwsArEto9gCX7A,pxDSSpmOW_HI3U8KtjH9Ow,DjlObNkmXApGsOQYKxgWQA,hmzSZMzyyqNiWzWzQarVEQ,2660nQeE1R0UFXItkNbulQ,zjv1PSIaSkn9lIzmCZXk7g,tErj36iHTW1WwoZBfLa8-A,F2TfcwCCwBqp17_FTZ5G9w

If you want to have an award winning burger experience, try the chipotle avocado burger! Seriously, one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.

The top of it, the owner is one of the friendliest business owner I've ever met, taking care of customers in a way that is way over any reasonable expectation. Highly recommended place for even the pickiest guests. "," Found this place on yelp and decided to try it out because of the high reviews. The food was pretty good, and the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful ",What an AMAZING place!! Top notch deli with fantastic employees!!! I had the Chicken Chipotle Panini and it was unbelievable! Located inside the office building behind the Marriot Hotel what a hidden gem I suggest you check this one out.,Excellent place for breakfast or lunch. I have never been disappointed but always pleasantly surprised. Were I come from a lot of small places like this are family owned and you're always treated like family.  It's nice to find a place with the same atmosphere. Thanks. See you soon.," This is a hidden gem in south Scottsdale. The place is run by a great family. The food was great, especially the sides! I'd like to come back and try the salads next time. "," Couldn't believe how good the burger from here was. I got the bacon and cheddar burger and it tasted like it came from an upscale ""fine"" burger restaurant. The prices are great and it's easy to get in and get out around lunch time. "," Good selection of great food and very friendly staff!  Breakfast, salads, deli sandwiches, hot sandwiches and paninis, burgers and hots. "," Had to follow suit and give this place a try. Its a wonderful little market with great food, great prices, and great service. One of the counter ladies gave me a cookie because she realized it was my first time in. Can't beat that! Makes me jealous because this is way better than the market at my office building.","Delicious food and burgers here. Service and staff are super friendly and you can tell they want to provide great service. It is family run and I get the impression they really pride themselves in what they do.

Oh yeah, Roberto is quite a friendly guy! ",Good healthy and fresh sandwiches. The place is not cheap for a sandwich but be sure of what you want but the food is good.," Best breakfast sandwich is the Laurel Market with goat cheese, eggs, bacon and your choice of homemade bread from Nova. Yum! "," Love love love their sandwiches. They're quick and convenient, and they offer many vegetarian friendly options. The only bad thing is that it can be difficult to choose which sandwich to go with. I haven't tried the breakfast sandwiches yet but hope to do so soon. Note that there are no tables. This is a place to grab a quick meal, snack or drink to go. ",Lots of very interesting sandwich and wrap options. Probably the most interesting and unique sandwiches and wraps ive ever had in one place to be honest. Definitely take time to read the menu. I have never even thought of a lot of the toppings they chose to put on their sandwiches. And they are all good. I've tried most," LOVE everything about this place - the employees, the sandwiches, the tid bit selection, the snacks and drinks! What I don't love is their use of styrofoam coffee cups. They are busy enough to spend a bit more on greener cups. C'mon guys invest into your community and environment. "," Great market for neat wine, snacks, and lunch! 

Beautiful salads with perfect avocados and fresh ingrediants. 

I recommend the chicken torta: black beans, chicken, avocado, cheese, tomato, on a bolillo roll. Yum, yum, yum! ","I don't know of a better place in Charlotte to get a sandwich or a wrap.  This one for me is an A+.  I've recently introduced (hooked) about 10 people at work onto Laurel Market.  It's at least a 45 minute round trip for us to go for lunch (takeout) but it's worth the time/gas!  So far, my favorite and the crowd favorite is the #4.  Most of us get it on a Spinach or Tomato Basil wrap.  It's incredible!  Turkey/Pepperjack/LTO/Bacon/Chipotle spread... unbeatable.","If you are looking for a fresh and friendly place to get a sandwich you should check out this shop.

4Wou6LarHqefHP21qRu0Ag,I've been here before when I've been treated bad or with a bad attitude. But today there was a cashier and she was alone in the whole store but she really made it work! And she was so nice to the kid I had with me. She really made this place so much better then I've ever seen it be. She should be a role model for everyone else who is working at this place!,Great food and smoothies but horrible service. This place is always way understaffed. Young kids working here and always arguing in front of customers and the wait time is really long.,"I want to give this place a good review, but its so tough when they are continually understaffed. I've never been here once when it took less than 3 minutes to get my order put in. It usually takes another 5-10 minutes to get a smoothie and half a sandwich too. If they could get this down to 3-4 minutes for a full order they would be 5-stars for sure."," I really like Tropical Smoothies establishments. However, this store is inefficient and dirty. No sense ordering ahead as your order isn't prepared till you arrive. Owners need to hire at least two people and teach them how to keep the place clean. ","Oh, I should have looked at the ratings before I ordered from this location. Shocker that it's so low. Not! Ordered a chicken salad sandwich toasted, baked lays chips and a smoothie. Got a salad and a smoothie. This was ordered on UberEATS as I'm working from home today, so paid 4.99 for delivery. Horrible! They don't answer their phone, so I can't even let them know."," Great smoothies, crappy service.  Miss Rosemarie, the heavyset brunette, should NOT be on the register.  Girlfriend is a little too gruff w/ customers & has attitude.  A little smile & a thank you would've been great.  Not a good representation of the store. ","I have been here before.  Never so dissatisfied.  My smoothie tastes like blended ice absolutely zero flavor. I was unable to order 3 different choices as they didn't have the ingredients.  I finally settled on my 4th choice and the chicken was all fat. Staff was friendly and apologetic , So not their fault","Stopped by after volleyball practice on a 95 degree evening to find one employee working. While it wasn't super busy, the poor lady was working her tail off to finish making orders so she could ring in new orders.. Poor thing was alone to run the show and she said she would be for the next hour n half. She was kind and friendly and still managed to do it all. Yeah, service was slow but I couldn't complain because she was working hard. She deserves a 5 star but this review will reflect that no smoothie place should have one employee like that and let alone not on a 95 degree May evening.","The smoothies here are great, the other food is hit or miss. They always seem to  be understaffed, which causes stress and tension between the staff themselves as well as between the staff and customers. There are times when it's busy but there's only one staff member.

The atmosphere is cozy and friendly.  We can not wait to return and try other dishes.","The donuts. The beignets. That's the reason why you should brunch at E2. My favorite is the chocolate pistachio. The doughnut was light and fluffy with the right amount of sauce to cover it. Be sure to bring cash since brunch is cash-only. You won't regret waiting for those steaming, delicious doughnuts!"," This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. They have very unique tastes and dishes. The wait staff is also very friendly. Their beignets are not my favorite though. However, I highly suggest trying their specials as well as their zeppollis. You have to get there really early or after the brunch rush though because there's usually a decent wait. "," Very good brunch, especially the donuts!  ""Lavender Lemon"" donuts!  I had also gotten their ""Kale and White bean hash.""  It was pretty good.  Ambiance is nice, very quaint.  The restaurant is much, much smaller than I had expected, so if you go at a busy time, expect to wait!  Wait staff was super pleasant. ",I usually love this place. But they did a really uncool thing that made me pretty mad. They turned us away from brunch even though there were open tables and an hour and a half before closing. Then the went ahead and seated a couple they were obviously friends with who got in right after us. Amazingly irritating. May be a long time until I return.," I like this place. The food was good and is ever changing. I guess that could be a good thing or a bad thing. I had banana bread pudding it was good, quite sweet. My girl had poached eggs with roasted tomatoes.

We were greeted upon entering and sat ourselves.  My friend & I both ordered 2 meat combo plates with mac & cheese as the side.  The brisket, hot links and ribs were delicious and the sauce was excellent. Only reason for four star rating is because the mac and cheese was a bit plain & they were out of collard greens.

Her upbeat attitude and contagious smile is very pleasant. She is the definition of great customer service. We've tried every meat that is on the menu and have not been unsatisfied. Highly recommend the pampered pig sandwich. It offers all the meats placed perfectly on a toasted bun with a side of barbecue sauce and is very fulfilling.

But they brought me a 3 piece chicken dinner when I order the fish dinner. I called Grub hub who stated the restaurant was sorry and they will credit me back 15.45 to my debit card I have never received that credit yet. To top it off my daughter wanted the Brisket combo we opened the box to Burned bun and all fatty brisket meat and a soggy burned bottom bun. I never received any refund from that.

I paid for my meal and left it there- no input from me could ever fix all the misses here.,"Really tasty BBQ food here. Service was excellent and food comes out hot and cooked. No waiting around, other than waiting for the food that is. Food amount is pretty big so there were leftovers for next time, which is awesome.

6LtbAtQKXWFj7QcqBnr6SA,I went last night and I have to give it 5 stars because everything was perfect! The service was phenomenal and the food was amazing! I couldn't have asked for a better experience.,Found a sushi place close by to the hotel I stay at.  Drinks were great and sashimi was amazing.  So fresh.  Just wish I knew what each fish was!," Keep driving. Perhaps hibachi is good. Ordered three items from the non-hibachi menu. Ebi shumai (shrimp) were small and bland. Hamachi jalapeÃ±o had no zip or spice, and worst of all, calamari tempura was barely warm and tough. Sent it back, came back quickly and it was hot and tough. The batter was not delicate, lacked taste, and was clearly cooked previously and heated up. Mikuni's in Sacramento   area (several) is the best, and I had hoped this would be a similar experience. Disappointed and not planning to return.

Wait person was prompt, friendly, and apologetic. ","Fun atmosphere.  Huge hibachi area as well as regular dining section as well.  I tried both the spicy tuna maki roll and the salmon hibachi dinner.  On tuesdays from 5-7 pm the maki rolls are half off.  The hibachi dinner includes onion soup, ginger salad, 3 shrimp, rice and noodles.  I enjoyed the entire meal.  It's not the best hibachi meal I've ever had but it did not disappoint me and its a fun dining experience. This place is ideal for groups or second dates."," Service was fast, food was decent.  Prices were fair.  Staff was nice. Scenery was cool. I'd go back. Not the beat sushi I've had but not bad. ",The best meal I have had in weeks.  Service was perfect.  Sushi was great. Meal was great.  Restaurant was clean and comfortable.  Short wait time. Drink had the perfect favor server was attentive and fast and was about to answer all of questions and was very personable.  I rarely give 5 stars but they surely deserve it.  I will be returning with a group for sure.,Service was terrible. Was told 20 minutes in reality it was over an hour with no explanation. They Seemed to be focused too much on theatrics and not quality food and service.,"Very good food, atmosphere and service. I recommend the calamari as an appetizer and the Angry Dragon as a main course. The drinks are good. I had a Long Island ice tea and it was very good. I give this place my highest recommendation. For 3 of us it came to $130. Not bad for what we had.",I went here the other day and everything was absolutely perfect. It has everything you could want from a sushi restaurant. They have a very attentive staff that was quick to handle my requests and those of my party.

2S9t90Q0qZWCV7X_u0rxZQ,Generic ramen. Decent service. Back maybe seven ten years ago they were one of the only options around and was good. Nowadays there are better options in the city.," Great, authentic ramen and atmosphere. Very flavourful and satisfying. Also excellent donburi. When they opened.

Unfortunately, over the past few months it feels as though their success has lead to a drop in quality of the food. In addition to this, one of my favourite comfort foods is no longer on the menu - donburi.

Will definitely check in from time to time as even on a bad day they're still one of the better options in the area. "," This used to be the only ramen place on Dundas and now it has been usurped by much better ramen joints. 

Granted, Kenzo showed up first and has retained it's laid back feel while some of the newer ramen restos are crowded and too cool for school.

The noodles at Kenzo are the eggy kind that I dislike. The soup in the tonkotsu ramen is milky like the way it should be. 

The takoyaki balls are pretty good but they (gasp) have gotten smaller! 

Sansotei down the street on the opposite side closer to University Ave is far better tasting and better priced. Go there instead... ","Really bad experiences gained today about the horrible services. It was my friend's birthday. The waiter told us there is no table for 8 ppl after we have waited outside for 15-20 mins. It's ok if there has no big table for big group, but waiter should tell us in the beginning instead of told us to wait. Wtf??? Really upset, never visit again."," Raman soup base doesn't taste good. It's the soul of the Raman, when it's not good the whole Raman is ruined. 
Have to come here because the other Raman place down the street has a long lineup. ","Food was so so but service was suck. Only three table was taken, waiters were sitting behind and chatting. I raised and waved my hand several times and nobody notice. Finally the bill came out with 17% gratuity....They even didn't ask how much tips you like to pay, they just sum up with 17% gratuity. Who wants to pay 17% for that kind of service? Be careful....so not Japanese"," I was there before for they open the store because my greyhound bus arrived early...when they open the door, I immediately ordered the house ramen. To my surprise, it came warm instead of hot, little slices of meat with my noodle soup. And my soup was just too salty so I asked for a cup of tea..but it was a tea bag tea with charge. I was very disappointed in their service. The waitress was busy talking to the guy cook instead of coming to check on my table. I had to walk to her to remind her that I was ready to pay the bill!!  Ridiculous! "," I work about a block away and I always look forward to trying out new places
that are around me, which are numerous.   I've tried most of the places on
this strip and I think Kenzo really stands out.

Excellent soup and great gyoza!!    This place makes some amazing Ramen
and I love going there for lunch time and time again.   

I usually get the Netsu-Ramen (Pork & Egg noodle) and I'll say that I probably
could eat this dish every day.

Great service, and
prices, I just wish the place was a little bigger.","This restaurant is a good place to check out if you want some ramen. The restaurant has a very authentic Japanese ramen shop feel to it. Some of the service isn't the best, but the food at least always comes out good with fresh noodles. It's definitely worth giving them a shot if you want some ramen quick.",F8C9fTynq-xQJIS3ZxG9ZA,ZuMPcUMZuL77CXTXhMJHVg,X3AxII_d0Q0q5epo94xY2w,X_KM77mbkN8_ikvqCpv7Zw,bMqklYPA3rMUlIbR_Oezag,LKqLFVTIt91V5KzIV23MbQ,9_6c335RW77tDuXKO3DIkw,4me7vgDGQkTFsLnmtfPx-A

I sampled almost every flavor while I was there but the subtlety of the green tea did it for me.

The owner is super-friendly
The shop is welcoming, to both adults and kids
The gelato is delicious

I recommend this to all the chocolate lovers (:,"""Aren't you missing the point?"" you might ask, as I order a scoop of 70% malt chocolate gelato from Art of Flavors, the artisan small-batch gelato shop just north of the Stratosphere. ""Why not get lemon curd? Why not get espresso? Why not get balsamic and gorgonzola? Why not get corn bread and Irish whiskey butter? Why? Why? Why?""

I'll tell you why. Because when it comes to dark chocolate, this is the perfect delivery system. You couldn't get higher off of a chocolate rush if you injected it.*

*Do not inject gelato. Even when it's this good.",This artisan style shop makes craft cocktails in the form gelato.

That is why I did not give it four stars.,Me and my husband love Jamaican food and this place was just recently recommended to us so we decided to try it. We had the jerk chicken (of course!) which was delicious  beef patty the best in Las Vegas and oxtail which didn't disappoint food was absolutely what I was expecting good! So why a 3 stars well because their customer service needs a lot of improvement and that makes me sad because a place with good food like paradise place needed good service to keep people coming back. Now that I know their food is good I might stop and pick something up but not in the near future.," OMG YASS so good i had the oxtails and rum cake 
Really tasty and so tender the rice and beans cooked perfect  i cant wait to try some more dishes  yum yum ill b back again forsure !!

I drove from the east side to the west side for it. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Great atmosphere and absolutely delicious plates. I ordered the ox tail!,"Purchased a Groupon there a little while ago. When we went the server said he needs to make sure if they have met there Groupon quota for the day, when we went it was about 4pm. Highly unprofessional. He didn't want to accept the Groupon and was explaining to us that it didn't make sense for him to have Groupon since it really wasn't a profit. Attitude was really nasty. Walked out and left, for a refund from Groupon.",This place was nothing short of just being incredible! From the minute we walked in - the smell was wonderful and The food smelled so delicious and it tasted even better! I got the Jamaican jerk chicken- my better half got the oxtail and of course wrote dinner we got chicken and beef patties!!! Not to mention we got a bomb rum cake!!!

You are very welcome Paradise Place for the review. I will not be returning. No thank you!!!",I was in the mood for Jamaican food and stopped by.  They definitely provided a delicious meal.  The jerk chicken was to die for.  It was filled with that spicy flavor I love.  The only thing I could complain about was the service.  The staff seemed rude and uncaring.

However, I will never again order a bowl of fresh fruit for $5 because it is just NOT worth it.  The dish was tiny, there was hardly any variety (or fruit, for that matter), and the pineapple was absolutely tasteless.  I've never had worse pineapple in my life, TBH.  But as far as drinks go, my beers were reliable and inexpensive. :)  And apparently my husband's tacos were very, very good.  Service was good, as well.",Ambiance is a bit sterile and simple.

The hostesses aren't the smartest bunch of girls in the world, ya know the type that's watching a basketball game and screams ""touchdown"". 


The food was OK, it wasn't so bland that I wouldn't be back but not great enough that I'm making sure we make time to stop in again. "," This is my favorite Majerle's! I haven't been to the one in Scottsdale yet but I haven't been disappointed with Marjele's. 

Marjele's in Goodyear is bigger than the one downtown but you can expect the same quality: good food, good drinks, great TVs, and great times! ","Tried Majerle's for the first time while in town for Spring Training and the food was great! My sister and I both and had burgers and were surprised by how large they were. The burger was excellent but the sweet bun really put it over the top. I would've given Majerle's only 4 stars but we had such excellent service.

Much love to Janie. She was amazing and didn't even mind that we were both dressed in Oakland A's jerseys, lol. Sweet, attentive, and awesome. Did I mention cute? She's cute. Thanks for the great service."," This is a very average sports bar. 

Strawberry chicken salad was tasty, but chicken was tough and over cooked and mixed greens had way too many browning pieces of lettuce. The candied pecans were delicious, though. 

Sliders meat to bun ratio wasn't good. Too much bread. Although they grill the buns in butter to try to make up for it. 

Thumbs up on the potato skins. 

Service was reaaaaaaaaally slow, even though they weren't that busy. "," While my boyfriend is in town for Nascar , he and his team stay down the street at a hotel near this bar and grill. Looking for nightlife options midweek this is what we found. Not bad! We sat at the bar. I ordered my famous snakebite... and yeah.. they had to ask, but they did it and it came out very well. Had to have two since they opened two ciders and two guinness to make the drink. Good music.. some nights there is karaoke. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The quesadilla on the appetizer menu is shareable and became a craveable favorite of my boyfriend and myself. Good bar!","The food here is great, and is a good value for your money.

From pastrami to corned beef to prime rib sandwiches and tasty wraps, to fresh salads and healthy smoothies, to mouth-watering cheesecake and other delectable desserts, you'll want to keep coming back to try something new. 

They only use the best ingredients between their freshly baked breads. You can choose from Ciabatta, Pumpernickel, Italian, Sourdough, white, wheat and many more. ","I do not know what an authentic Brooklyn deli is like but this place has some good fresh food and nice employee's. I always get the Country Dijon egg salad and I am never disappointed. I have had others, the turkey and a salad which both tasted great. I have never had a complaint about the food, every time the it tastes great.

We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot. 

The place was VERY clean. The owners(?) were there, and very friendly. My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good. I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome. Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container.

I always get chicken pad thai with a side of white rice. I am not disappointed by it, it certainly kills my pad thai cravings, but its not my absolute favorite pad thai. Their excellent customer service here (that I have experienced anyway) certainly makes up for that. And for that reason, is why I keep going back.

See you soon Sin City Thai Restaurant! "," Green curry and pad Thai were both fantastic. The flavors were full and well layered. 
Not much for ambiance, but the flavors more Tha. Make up for it! "," Normally this is a place to go during lunchtime because it's close enough to my wife's work.

Check out their daily specials too! ",I went to this place for late night food so there was not a whole lot of choice that I knew of.  The food was your typical bar food.  It was nothing spectacular but I would go back if I had to for some food.  One thing that was funny...my buddy tried to order Negro Modelo since there were signs advertising this beer and it was no longer available.,My only experience at Gallagher's was similar to the one described below by Glenn G.  Went there with a large group from work and found the service to be excellent.  Everyone enjoyed the food.  Rarely do you have a large party (we had about 10) and request separate checks without getting attitude; but here they were happy to do so.  Based on this visit I would recommend Gallagher's.," Very disappointed today.  Stopped in for some wings and drinks. Apparently management decided to send some staff home for lack of traffic. Unfortunately there were not enough staff to take care of the customers that did show up. After waiting far too long, had to go to the bar multiple times to order and deliver our own drinks. This was a problem a year ago and it seemed management got the message and service became very good. Don't know if this is going to continue but it does will be returning very often. "," Gallaghers is like most sports bars, bar food and beer! This is the type of place you come to hang out after work. Lots of regulars.

This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees. Management: Stop offering discount wings during happy hour, your staff gets rude to people who order them because they believe they aren't going to get a descent tip, your not helping yourself.","Can't expect anything super amazing from a place like this.

They also make GREAT drinks.,"I love sushi, and maybe I'm a little bit of a snob about it living in California for 11 years. But I just can't get down with this place after trying it a couple times. 
The sushi is cut very thickly and has a very bland taste. Which I guess is better than a fishy taste, but it's just not good on the palate. Maybe it's the distance the fish has to travel. But I've been to a couple other sushi places in Ohio and they were a lot better. 
It's probably in part the sushi chef's knife skills. It seems like it's trying hard to be cool. It misses the mark for me."," In town for a business meeting and wanted sushi.  A quick walk from the hotel.  It was a quite Thursday night so I practically had the place to myself.  The choices were plenty and when I asked if they could make a Christmas Tree roll, the chef did not hesitate.  It was very good.  I enjoyed the Rainbow roll also.  The waitress was very helpful in  suggesting some of Sushi Rock's special rolls.  Definetly will visit when I am in town again. "," we stopped in while passing through.  good sushi, although the waiter seemed amazed that we'd actually had sushi before!  he did walk us through a complicated menu, and we found what we liked just fine.  a little pricey but not horridly so. ",Hard to find free parking in downtown Cleveland but the walk was worth it. Fast friendly service and sushi and rolls were great. Atmosphere was nice too.,"The service here was horrible. My work colleague had his food come out literally 20 minutes after everyone else had already finished their meal. To top it off, most of the dishes were mediocre at best, especially the sushi, which had generous portions but was not good enough to justify the price.  The filet mignon was good however.","What can I say....its sushi. They've been around for years. Weds you need a reservation for half priced sushi night. A few of my favorites are the Big Mouth (spicy), Spider (soft shell crab) and Caterpillar.  Sounds funky but they are the big rolls.  Plus they have my all time favorite dish....Kani Su (spelling?) its a bit of crab wrapped in a peeled cucumber and soaking in a light vinegar type.  Very light and I think I could eat 5 appetizers of these things.",I highly recommend the volcano roll or the dragon roll but avoid 1/2 off night unless you want to wait forever and only get the cheap items.,Stopped by this place because I was in the city and wanted to try out some sushi.

"," Just happened to pass by the place tonight and decided to give it a try.  My wife had the goulash and I had the pork with cream mushroom dish.  Both were extremely fresh and very good!   The dinner salad was OK, but I say that only because I don't like frilly salads like theirs (with dandelion, etc.). The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.  It feels like a family owned type of place, where a lot of love and hard work was put into it.  It's not easy to spot and it's made even more difficult to find because they have outdoor screens covering their storefront...can't tell they are open.  I would definitely recommend...  Very good! "," Went with hubby try it out. He used to work in a German restaurant, so he was a little more critical about the food. He kept telling me how things ""should"" have been done.  We both thought it was overpriced, under portioned. We were the only ones in the restaurant  (other than staff) the night we went, which should have been a warning to us. Everything was meh.
We did enjoy the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream, but hated to hear the microwave door slam shut before the strudel arrived at our table.
I wonder how long they will be in business...so sad cause we love local mom/pop restaurants. "," I was dying to try this place being of German/Polish decent, boy was I disappointed! Hubby had the German Bockwurst & fries, it was like a giant boiled hot dog, fries OK. I had the Schnitzel Vienna Style, the pork was very dried out, no taste. Now I have eaten quite a few potato pancakes in my day, my mom used to grate them by hand, and fry them in a pan. These were like the took leftover mashed potato formed them into a patty and deep fried them! MUSHY!  Needless to say my long awaited adventure clear across town was a bust, save your money! "," New customer lost to greedy owner.
First visit today for a quick lunch.  Ice tea came, my wife took one sip and said she did not like it and  sent it back and only had water.  Schnitzel was bland and Beer Bratwurst was sub-par.  The lentil soup however was delicious.  Check came with charge for tea which I questioned and was told that owner said she had a sip so we had to pay for it!!!  You've got to be kidding...will now not go back. Also, pre-packaged yellow mustard in a German restaurant. ",What a hidden gem. You can tell every dish is homemade. The food service and everything about this place is worth 6 plus stars. I highly recommend and will be coming back!!,"This place is not a good experience. The food is sub-par and mediocre, and the attitude of the owner is something that is a disappointment. The price is way too much for the quality of the food is much to be desired. It is not really authentic like it should be.

Also they only use special thread that 100% organic and no one in any threading spot in vegas using that. My eyebrows looking best and I never go back to waxing.,I liked this place close to home and very clean. The customer service was great and my daughter liked it too. will be coming back.,This was my first time and I was a bit worried. But my eyebrows turned out awesome! It only pinched a bit on the bottom part of the eyebrow. I'm so glad I came here! Threading from now on.,As a guy I always had to get my brows clean up. Having waxing all the time made my brows thinner and thinner by the day. Finally I found this place next to wal mart and I tell you that these ladies know the job done on point.

You are the best.," My sister and I came here looking for a new place to get our eyebrows done! We were so satisfied with the job done here. Priya (I hope that's how its spelled) is wonderful! Very sweet, and she is very gentle when working on sensitive areas such as the eyebrows and upper lip area. She was honest about the shape of my brows and gave suggestions about how to improve them. Usually it's a painful experience to get my eyebrows threaded, but it didn't hurt one bit here! Makes me wonder what the other places I've been going to have been doing to me this whole time. Love it, will return. ",Nari is amazing. I had a horrible experience at eyebrows r us and she got my eyebrows back to looking amazing :) I highly recommend her!," I was looking for a new eyebrow place close to my house and came across them on Yelp. The places is very clean and organized  and they also sell really nice purses. I went to Priya and she was AMAZING! She took her time and shaped my eyebrows very nicely. I have a natural arch and she made them even better. She also gave me tips on growing them out thicker and longer and even used a ""brow mascara"" that filled them in very nicely. I will DEFINITELY be going back!! "," This place is awesome and professional,  the lovely women at the shop are always so friendly ..... And the brows are always on point!!

2z7xERz1Nonyw8Kjr4SffA,This place is so awesome and the manager is such a cool dude always remembers my name even remembers my order. Highly recommend this place do fish tacos. Insane topping bar.,"From 3-6pm they have 2$ fish tacos, they come bare but have a condiment bar with everything you need. French fries were perfect and the fish was great!",The fish tacos are exceptional. Best I've ever had!!!  Will definitely go back for Taco Tuesday!!!  Love this place.,"Got fish tacos. I noticed they batter and fry their own fish which you just won't see at most fast dinning restaurants. The tacos are served plain but there is a toppings bar with just about all you could want. For the fish tacos especially I loved the slaw and the not-from-a-can/jar tartar sauce with just a drizzle of the very hot sauce. I will definitely go here again!

5 stars based on it being exemplary in it's category of fast-casual food. Definitely up there with some other recent novel additions in this category in the Phoenix area (like fast casual pitas/hummus bowls).","Pros: The food was cooked and served quickly. Plenty of meat in the tacos. They are served plain (just meat and tortilla) and then you get to help yourself to the salsa bar. Out of the 3 tacos I tried (Carne Asada, Surf & Turf, Full) I enjoyed the Carne Asada most. The beef of the Carne Asada taco and the Surf and Turf tacos were well seasoned.

Cons: I'm not a huge fan of the battered layer on the fish and shrimp. However, I will be back for their Carne Asada tacos! Also, the bathroom doesn't have mirrors, but that's besides the point.",Really good fish & shrimp tacos.  Quick and easy place to grab a bite.  My kids loved it my hubby loved it that combo for me an A+,Not from this part of town. A local recommended this newly opened place. I was very impressed with the fish taco...generous serving of lightly battered fish - topping bar had many options. I got to dress it My Way!!  They have Taco Tuesday buy two get one Free!!,I love Tortilla Fish.  Anytime we are in the area we go. I always order too much because I want one of each.  The full taco is my favorite!  The home made ranch with the French fries is also hard to beat.,"I came here in the mood for some fish tacos because I heard the place was great.  I must admit, this place is as good as its reputation.  Their fish tacos were delicious!  They also have some really good shrimp tacos.

#NAME?,"Today was my first time eating here! I must say I was truly impressed. The service was fast and the food was delicious. I had 1/4 lb burger with American cheese, green chile, 1000 Island Dressing and pickles. The family who owns it are very friendly. I highly recommended this place.","I am a gourmet chef and in general I'm pretty hard on restaurants.  The food has to be at least as good as I make at home.  Well, I tell ya, Lucky's burgers beat mine by a long shot.  I tried Lucky's for the first time yesterday and I have to say that Lucky's burgers are better tasting than any of the chain burgers, even 5Guys.  The place was CLEAN! The staff was very friendly and helpful."," Best burger I've had in a long time.
Try the double and load it up with bacon.  The charbroiled taste is like right off the grill.  Frys are seasoned and cooked perfect.   Will be back for sure. "," The burgers, chili cheese fries and shakes were delicious! Very clean place and the service was excellent. We will definitely be back!

Eat here. Owner runs the place with her father cooking. Sweet.," Finally stopped in here. The menu has burgers, dogs, gyros, fries and shakes. Thats about it. The green chili burgers, fries and banana shake are all great. The staff (both of them) were friendly and quick. Its a tiny place but its clean and efficient! A burger will run you about what a whopper does but its better. Don't hesitate to try this place! Oh, there's no public restrooms btw...so plan accordingly. ","Staff here is friendly and helpful, tried this place twice and will not be coming back. 

The first time I tried the 1/4 burger and it tasted alright but it tasted like a burger king burger.

Went back a second time a got a meal. The fries were excellent and cooked perfectly. The burger was a huge disappointment. It was extremely greasy and didn't taste great. In-n-out has much better burgers and half the cost.",If you are in the mood for the best burger around then head to Lucky's right now. This restaurant makes a fantastic quality burger that blows away the competition.

#NAME?,"What an unbelievably amazing place to go. This is by-far my favorite place to go on a slower night rather than the party scene. Go in there have a few delicious exotic beers and talk to some down-right friendly people. The owner Pete is awesome as well. All the waiters, waitresses, bar tenders, and of course Pete make you feel like family who just got home. It's an absolutely wonderful place to go. BE SURE TO TRY A DARK AND STORMY DOWN THERE! ","In loooove. Especially with the frites (and that aioli?!) and the southwestern Caesar salad - it tastes like guacamole and a Caesar salad mixed together. Amazing. Service is always attentive and friendly. Prices are reasonable, too; I got a great, filling lunch with a friend for $10 each."," Good coctail. Service was awesome. I had the polenta. Pretty good. I'm not sure how the polenta was cooked... little mealy. I would've preferred it be pan fried or something. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich. He said it was good, especially the bacon aioli. "," Met a few friends for dinner last night- we were seated right away, but it was very early.  As we were eating, the place filled up very quickly so keep that in mind.  
The menu was varied with both pub foods, salads and entrees- I really enjoyed the Amy's salad and I'm not really a fan of spinach but it was delish.  The veggie sandwich was likewise satisfying and the service was just fine.  Overall, we were impressed and will plan to return often. "," Best burger I've had in Madison - loved that the bread is more of a brioche than a bun.  Service was friendly and prompt.  My only wish is that they turned the volume on the tvs down a bit.  Yes, they're showing European football matches, so it's better than your average bar, but a little less volume would go a long way. ","This place is so-so.  The food was ok, I had the steak frites. It was about 6 slices of a small steak and just blah fries topped with a strange sweet sauce(not sure why). My partner had a vege special with chanterelle mushrooms that was really well seasoned. The bone marrow app was under seasoned and just blah again. I found the service super slow and the place too loud for my tastes. Overall, Brasserie V is way, way better!  Rather spend my money there."," I heard great things about it, but it was only ok for me. I had a chicken sandwich and it wasn't terrible, but the chicken was clearly processed. It is also VERY noisy inside. However my wife really liked her salad and they have a good beer selection. "," My Bavarian Beer Stew was dry - I don't think it could be fairly called a stew because there was no liquid in it.  On the bright side I got to watch my dining partner eat the Sconnie Egg - and it tasted as delicious in my mind as it did in his mouth.

Beer - yup, lots. Friendly eager to please waiter who apologized when our entrees were delivered right along with our appetizers. Who's running the kitchen?","It's not as amazing as some people say. Not saying it's bad, because it's actually really good, but not the best ever. There's quite a lot of variety here in foods, from burgers, to sandwiches, to guacamole and salads. Pretty much everything you'd expect. The food quality is good, and service is fast, but they definitely cut corners by using processed foods. Not all fresh.

0bjFYstj8USMzEV4ZQldjA,Love this place and the coffee is so good! I don't usually care for being a coffee snob but I honestly can drink it black because it's so good. Expected prices to be too high for me but they are really fair. Medium coffee is $2 and lattes are $3-4. It's also great to support the new business. Highly recommend trying this out and supporting the local business.," Excellent coffee/espresso. Happy he's finally got his own show to run. Hope he has an excellent, long run. The coffee community is better with Braden in it.

That said, I'd love for anyone complaining about the quality of Crazy Mocha's Oakland shop to say that to Emily's face, lol.

Disclaimer: Have known Braden for years, back with TdO and EaM. And I currently work for Crazy Mocha. "," Certainly a delicious coffe, and very friendly people. 
Cool spot! "," Can't believe there is an independent and FRIENDLY coffee shop in Oakland! Not snobby at all-- nice and light inside, they will toast bagels for you, serious about coffee-- roasted in Lancaster PA. Oat milk and almond milk options. "," If you haven't checked out this coffee place yet, you absolutely have to! Very conveniently located  near all of the major hospitals in Oakland, it's one of the best coffee places in town. The owners are extremely nice and knowledgeable. I'm thrilled to have a great coffee shop in Oakland, and I'm especially lucky to have it right next to my office! It is also very reasonably priced. The coffee is unbelievably good, so support the local business! "," Amazing coffee, wonderful service, great treats. Best coffee shop in Pittsburgh. "," This coffee was so good! I got the cold brew which comes in a glass bottle. A little pricey but it is so smooth. There was no need for any type of milk/creamer. The only downside is that there isn't much seating so it's more of a grab and go type coffee shop. It's also a little hidden and if you don't know where you're going, you may miss it! (Hint: it's next to the donut shop.) I'll surely be back.

The parking situation is metered street parking. It's fine if you work or live in the area, then you can just walk and not have to deal with that hassle. ",Great coffee great atmosphere and super friendly staff.  Nice place to visit along the college strip. Check em out.,"Has the best coffee in town. Well, maybe not the best, but absolutely yummy.

During the transaction, the staff realized the sign they posted for the .40 caliber ammo was incorrect.  Instead of offering me the ammo at the advertised price, they promptly removed the sign and said we would have to pay more for the ammo.

I'm a novice in the gun world and had many questions prior to choosing my rifle and the guys (mainly one, but two others chimed in as well) were incredibly patient and helpful in answering all of them.  We spent probably 45 minutes to 1 hour discussing the functions of the different parts on the gun  along with comparing/contrasting different makes and models.

They have changed for the worse I will go somewhere else they treated my husband like he was stupid and that was sad honestly. Much better service and gun stores out there folks promise","Nice store. Pretty friendly and relaxed, but lacking in professionalism. As far as gun stores go, it is what it is.

The staff is great - very professional and friendly. I gave it three stars because there is an over-abundance of lemon on two of the dishes we tried. We ordered the octopus, which was a little tough and tasted like lemon and oregano. Then we got brussels sprouts as a side - also drowning in lemon. It just overpowered both dishes.

The eggplant isn't babaganoush and I'm not sure what it was...It lacked the smoky flavor I thought it would have like a babaganoush!

The octopus (FYI not local! Despite the ""everything local"" them the restaurant goes for) was chewy and didn't have any flavor. It was hard to get through it all (sorry for being harsh!) 

The place has a cute feel to it so I'll give it that!","This restaurant is a great place to check out if you're in the mood for some vegetarian food.

Rented a car for a ~400 mile roundtrip excursion.  Cheapest rates by far. No wait when I picked up my car on a Saturday, car was as promised.

Make sure you read what you sign! The contract I was presented when picking up the car had a .50 charge per mile over 100 a day, while the terms I agreed to online said unlimited.  I had them cross that off and initial it before I agreed to sign.

The lounge is also nice, and I love free soda.","I reserved my rental car through Travelocity and I was thoroughly pleased. I was a little skeptical because the rental with tax was only $194 and some change. The staff are super friendly and the rental place is very bright, a nice orange color. They offer you various drink choices (all non-alcoholic, of course), I will definitely rent from here again. Thanks.",I had a great rental experience here. I found them through Kayak and then booked a prepaid reservation directly on the Sixt site. The price was right - $49/day for three days' rental of a BMW 328i.

The return was also similarly fast and there were no fees or foolishness there either.,"We had never heard of this company. There price for rentals is what brought us to them.

#NAME?,"Below average Chipotle. Chips were stale, portions where small, staff was nice though. Ordered a burrito and the girl used a ripped tortilla. When she first saw it she started to get a new one but couldn't pull it out right away so she gave up and used the ripped one. Slightly disappointed. I'm not expecting fine dining, but would at least like it to be comparable to other visits. "," I love Chipotle, but this one gave me FOOD POISONING. Whoever it was I talked to at their corporate wasn't quite helpful, although the manager at this Chipotle was very accommodating when I reported the food poising. They're  nice, but the quality they make when it comes to burrito is not great. It would spill or the burrito wouldn't be wrapped properly. I prefer going to other Chipotles than this one. ","Possibly the worst Chipotle I've been to in town. Most of the employees that have served me barely put anything in my bowls. I asked for a little bit more steak, and the lady literally scoops out 1 piece of steak. Cheese? They sprinkle that on there like it's the last bucket of cheese they have for the next month. And the guacamole? Guac is extra, so I expect at least a proper scoop. She gives me half a scoop. Seriously? In the end I feel like I'm not eating a steak bowl, but rather a vegetable one.","Well I love Chipotle and since I was with my sister after shopping it was the closest location, it was her first time eating here. The food was great but the redhead that works their was rude and impatient to my sister, she's only 12 and it was her first time and she wasnt sure what to get so the red head was rolling her eyes and idk If she's gonna work for a fastfood place she needs to learn to be patient. Other than that 4 stars good food that's why! Burrito Bowl my favorite!",I eat here almost everyday for lunch! The wait can be long at certain times but worth the wait- the regular staff is awesome and friendly and they remember my order - I only have issues when they have visitor or new employees but they still get 5 stars because they move the line and are friendly and the food is always fresh and amazing!,"As a UNLV student I always find myself at chipotle for lunch in between classes or picking up something to take home after a long day. This particular location is ALWAYS busy, therefore the foods always fresh ! Even though all of the employees are fairly young, the service is great. They'll let you sample things you haven't tried, and suggest a new spin to put on your burrito. Love love love. 

I only doc 1 star because the lines between 12 and 2 (lunchtime) are lonnnnnnnnng. And they will not make quesadilla style burritos during lunch rush (lame).",i like getting the 3 taco combo here. the salsa is so flavorful! i like getting the bowls too. heck.. i like everything here! the only downside is you gotta eat really fast or get a separate basket for the tacos cuz they get really soggy at the bottom from the juice from the meat and salsa. they get so soggy the taco comes apart before you bite into it. but if you can get it into your mouth without the insides falling out from the split.. kudos!," Below standard, even for Chipotle. Rice was not cooked all the way. Food was lukewarm. Salsas were flavorless(maybe not fresh?) Pretty disappointing.","Chipotle is normally a high quality fast food restaurant where you can get high quality burritos and chicken/rice bowls.  This particular Chipotle however, is anything but high quality.  They don't give you enough food to eat.  The food they do give you to eat is stale or old.  Even if its not old food, they way they give it to you is usually very sloppy.

Also, super clean, especially the bathrooms. Staff was very friendly. Would definitely come back! "," Fun place! Glow putt is an awesome idea with a unique spin on mini putt. Also, it's indoors which is nice for living in Arizona. Great atmosphere inside with music, colors, and black lights. Owner was very friendly too. Had a great time here!

Great place for family fun," I've been here a few times now, and I love it! Definitely fun for a date or just something to do. My only complaint is that either each obstacle for each hole are longer or create more holes! One round goes by too quickly! Plan on possibly going this Sunday for a double date! "," This place is definitely worth the price. They give you a glow in the dark bracelet to start, and you have the chance to win a free round on the last hole. There were a lot of kids there, but as an adult I didn't feel out of place at all. The setup is great inside and I love the little extra touches, like the wheel you spin at one hole that gives you challenges to complete and the ball charging stations. My only complaint is that it got pretty warm in there. Otherwise everything was fine. ","We just visited this place over the weekend for the first time. We used a groupon for $20.00 me, my husband and two kids could golf! That was a great deal! The place is a little small ans could be a bit cleaner but overall we had a blast and the glow in the dark theme is a great idea!"," We recently went here on my son's bday. The kids thought it was super cool and the courses were fun and challenging. Also, being able to charge your golf ball was so neat to them. Will be back in the future.",This was a really cool place for the kids to enjoy.  The glow in the dark atmosphere is something unique that will leave them with their jaws dropped!

I have gotten their medium one topping only $9.48 +tax which is perfect for just the two of us, its always hot, delicious, a bit greasy(which makes it good) and has the best cheese, to bread, to meat, to crust ratio out of any pizza I have had.

I paid extra for a fried egg and it was cooked over hard, I didn't know I needed to specify that it should be over easy. The burger had no flavor. The sweet potatoes fries were good but a little under cooked. The staff was very friendly and attentive but the food was underwhelming.

I think for the first few days of being in operation that they are doing a great job. Both times I was there were not lunch hours so maybe that's why my experience was different than the other negative reviewers.

Great beer list, wine. Reasonable prices. Friendly people. Patio. Score! Check it out. ","Fun little spot for burgers and sandwiches. We stopped in for a late lunch after a trip to Edgewater Park. It's only about a half mile away so a perfect stop after the beach. We had our dog with us so sat on the patio, which was perfect. We enjoyed a mix of sandwiches and burgers and we're pleased with the vegetarian and vegan options offered. Everything was huge, especially the burgers which were really thick. For sides, the sweet potato fries and 3 bean salad were clear winners.

They did a great job cleaning up and decorating the patio - which is now a great place to watch all kinds of neighborhood happenings. 

I've heard from people who know that they have a great burger - so that's next on my list. ","Absolutely amazing! The menu offers a wide variety of great tasting food. In our party of 5 we all ordered something different and each and everyone of us was blown away by the taste, freshness and size of it all! This is a place that you need to come back time and time again to get the full experience. Not to mention the friendliness of the staff and the quickness in which the food was prepared. Along with the food they also have a wide variety of beer to perfectly pair with your meal (and they don't silently judge you for getting a beer with your early lunch!)."," Freshness at it's finest. I admit that I don't eat here often, even though it's only a block from my house. I don't do fast casual that often. However, when I do get in there, it is always right on the mark for what I craved. The folks who work there are always nice, and when the weather permits, their patio is a great spot to eat and hang out.","The best thing about this place is the fact that there's something for everyone.  If you have a group of friends that are vegetarian, they have stuff on the menu.  If you have heavy meat eater friends, there are lots of amazing burger options.  They also have a great alcohol menu with wine and beer to try out.

There is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is very expensive but if you use the Internet you can find a budgetary way of paying for it. It's worth it. 

No long walks...at all. Elevator to pool? Your there. Elevator to casino? Your there. 

Trust me people. Stay here. I'll never stay at another hotel in Vegas after this weekends  experience.  And I'm kind of poor. "," Exactly what you would expect of the Four Seasons, clean and comfortable rooms, friendly staff, excellent food and amenities.

The only negative is the pool is a little on the small side...but you have access to Mandalay Bay and their pools. "," Beautiful hotel! Really enjoyed my stay. The presidential suit is gorgeous! Great hotel to stay in if you want something in the strip, but not in a casino. The rooms are awesome and the staff is amazing. Definitely would stay here again.

Would absolutely recommend!," Great new alternative to Chipotle, and a lot more to offer here.  Great food, very reasonably priced and interesting modern design elements in the interior.  Fortunately for us, it's also close to home. We will definitely be back. "," Chipotle has nothing on this place! It is a build your own burrito at the counter style place, but with so many more options. Tons of different meats and salsa to choose from. The spicy avocado salsa is amazing! And the nachos. Man those nachos! Ask for a frequent buyers card so you can get discounts. I was very impressed with the service as well. They were very friendly and seemed to enjoy their job, which you typically don't see in fast food style places like this.  And lastly, prices are reasonable and portion sizes are generous. I could not finish my burrito bowl in one setting. Leftover were just as good!","I really like this place.  its a great way to get some healthy mexican style food at a good price.  The have tons of fresh veggies that go into your taco or burrito, so you don't feel guilty.  The salsa is amazing!  Its definitely a place for vegetarians and meat lovers alike!",tk9vnQYfb73yL0E-EIGmIg,VU3nMxPACkeGMx8jsMPALg,dwPNcA7toDEZiiiPe_ueXw,4Ps5RWHpWnNFM7eLlMS11g,bJbwbxwhZf1OfxXbpyO0rQ,_dUz2E6tc5v2lImQtQAMQQ,ZFwsXLs09YMiYeta_pzuHg,C1qGrNX7TPR9rXXCm2v0qA
59OgPGGzKFYqwSG_U06kuA,"Came here with family out of town (Tustin, CA and Houston, TX) and we were impressed with the korean food here.  The Galbi and Bulgogi was delicious (tender and juicy) along with the a generous portion of the spicy squid.  Price is comparable and usual like other korean restaurants.  The only thing maybe have more of a variety of banchan (two of them were seaweed wrap). "," If you are a asian, you must try this restaurant. The tofu soup with seafood is so good! And there will be a long line if you get there too late ",Very good short ribs and tofu soup... Great korean food in Phoenix! Will definitely be back for more!," My boyfriend picked up some random dishes on his way over one day. Everything was delicious! I didn't care for one of the sides, but seriously, I LOVED everything else. I will definitely be going there again, maybe this time I will go in person. I would highly recommend the spicy tofu soup, it was delectable. I can't stop craving it!! ",Great place to get your Korean cravings satisfied in southern Arizona.  The place was busy and they carry your standard Korean dishes.  The side dishes were alright but better than none.," We come here often after having lived in Korea for over a year. 

I love the yu kei chong and the bulgogi. In wife gets dolsot and bipimbop. The Kimchi is excellent. They've got the Korean OB beer. 

Highly recommend. "," This is my benchmark for Bulgogi even after I moved back to Silicon Valley, where there are a ton of Korean restaurants. They also serve excellent tofu soup and cold noodles. "," Awesome service and attentive.  Authentic Korean, the best tofu soup.  This is my go-to place especially when I'm not well.   Nothing like a steaming bowl of spicy goodness to warm yourself up. Sides are delicious too!","If you want some delectable Korean food, then definitely come here!  The tofu soup is packed with flavor!  There is something here for everyone.  The ribs are simply amazing!  They are tasty and will definitely fill you up!",HwwQMIzZ8ilX58Nu2JNrig,WtoFWzwqjbaLu8OmBf49FA,WZ-AP-f2h9cuqm33t5FiXQ,Tha8pfPBUygU0m_CIP_AWw,mDauaZa7hThSy76As74NJw,gjYmL4Pnq-y8TB8bv0rkbg,i_n09ULyeIEjraQlP5OyOg,5hkjTLjX7XVwiWkWjOf-6g
4M09MJwxRx8utAgEntFVrQ,"Went here recently for a happy hour. Much like other reviews state, this is an average bar/restaurant with average food and drink. I had the bruschetta to eat and it was a huge filling portion. It was OK. Nothing extraordinary to write about. ",Simple bar and grill with a simple menu. I recommend the salmon sliders and the tater tots.,One hour wait for mediocre food.  But at least the place pumps uber loud music so everyone had to scream to be heard.,"Great place to watch games.  Had about five tvs.  The best thing at bar louie is there 4-7pm weekday happy hour.  I wish they offered a late night happy hour also.
The drinks on regular menu as well as food is overpriced for the quality.  The chicken nachos were stale.  The fatheads bumble berry small was over 6$.  So i'd probably only go here for happy hour.","The bar area was packed on a friday evening and I met a group of about 12 girls for a bday celebration.  The waitress was sooooo slow and never checked on us and messed up our drink order repeatedly.  We would have to actually go and look for her when we needed something.  We ordered about 7 apps for the table and although they were good, it did not make up for the lackluster service.  If your in for drinks and people watching then its ok but wouldn`t go out of my way to come here again.",Went for lunch today on my lunch break with some work friends. It took them 40 mins for them to get our food. During this time we asked for it to get our food in boxes-because at this point it took 80% of our break to even get the food. Not once did our server apologize for the ridiculous wait or even let us know what was going on in the kitchen. Keep in mind we ordered very basic menu items.  Once the food finally came out it was mediocre at best. Never going back-especially for lunch.,"This place is hit or miss. The food, when it's timely and correct, is pretty great. Good drinks too. But on more than one occasion, the service has been terrible. We actually had a serve get fired in the middle of serving us! Recommend that you sit at the bar and order drinks. It you're determined to eat, make sure it's not when they are crowded!

**Update**
I can't make this up. Went to Bar Louie for brunch on 9/10. The cook messed up our order of omelettes TWICE!!!! And the coffee was cold. I am done with this location.","I've given this place several chances before giving up completely. We always sit at the bar, and the bartenders literally ignore us. There's no way you don't see me and my guests sitting, without drinks. And it's never super busy when we have gone in! Your bartenders need to learn to at least acknowledge - a very basic customer service trait. When you finally do revive a drink, it sits empty forever! I spent years tending bar and would never treat guests this way. 

Ps - had a group of 8 girlfriends wanting to go tonight and I warned them not to because your service is horrendous. They went to Cheesecake instead.",The staff here are slow and at times ignore the customers. The food and drinks are nothing to write home about and are pretty over priced. The wait times are long for meals and the food is often over cooked or even stale. It even takes a ridiculous amount of time to get drink refills.,YkDB39sjmd_Qgz7U2lMI4A,MLVzc6FSyXF8xeXhJNE2AQ,FWVLRajF575wsChJq7IC4Q,#NAME?,DDIb9tP9l9vwda78dx1vMQ,Yim62ABSz4hn1m5pzVQLdQ,tTr7GjAgPzkLfB7kwz9q9g,CyNGukMRcpOCuCwxcwDU6Q
0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw,Been coming here since I moved to Vegas! Sad they moved the location but this is def. a great spot for Mexican dishes and Margaritas =),Great food and great service. The chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious!," Chapalas is a great mexican restaurant. The staff are very friendly and welcoming upon arrival. The seating is very good and there is enough space that you do not feel cramped. My family and I usually go on Sunday's when they have the buffet. The food is always fresh and they are quick to restock if an item is low. Generally, buffet food is something left to be desired, but not at Chapalas. My family and I will keep coming here as long as it is open! I definitely recommend this restaurant. ",If I could give this place less then one star I would! It's not very often I rate something this low just because I give points for effort but it's like this place stopped caring and started serving crap! I ordered a taco chili relleno and enchilada combo the only edible item on my plate was the enchilada.  My husband ordered the fajitas and it came on a not a fajita plate just a regular plate with lettuce and pico it was a very sad excuse for a fajita meal! Don't waste your time money or gas going to this place! Oh and to top off crappy food the service is just as bad as the food!,You Can't Go Off Reviews Where People Don't Know The Real Deal Been Coming Here Since 1987 So Yes I Do Know Authentic Mexican Food And The Bottom Line I'm Treated Like Family When I Dine Here I'm Not Apologizing To Trolls That Have No Clue What Their Talking About," My friend and I ate here on vacation, and we were largely unimpressed. Our server was abrupt and unfriendly. I got a beef burrito but was surprised when it came out with no sauce on top (it was just a simple tortilla with beef and beans in it). It would have been very plain had I not poured some of the chip salsa on top. My friend got a shrimp dish which he thought was decent. ",I gave it one star only because the service was excellent. The mild salsa is tomatoe sauce with chili powder. The hot salsa is mild enough for a Midwesterner. They put VegAll in EVERYTHING! Seriously? Potatoes and Lima Beans in Tamales? Carrots and Corn in taco meat? I'm frankly embarrassed they are even in business. It is a great dishonor to a fine cuisine that I love dearly. Great service but the food is horrendous. Do not waste your time and money. Honestly? Taco Bell is better!!!!,I love this place been going for YEARS and i go ESPECIALLY FOR THE SALSA!! i would drink it if i could..i sometimes order and entree but i usually get chips and some appetizers.  Best salsa in vegas dont care anybody says!!!,If you're in the mood for some authentic Mexican food this is one of the best places to go in Vegas. They have been around for over thirty years and continue to make fantastic fresh Mexican food. The service here is also very friendly and attentive. Their salsas are all made fresh in house and are some of the best in town as well. I highly recommend checking out this place!,460ThtL6eqjCQ_5jn57cXQ,t8RKlHLRxN5KFV-8qw9UCA,cuFxYlOjuR2U0TDOKOcOSg,tYlkhMQ_dVW9Ylme3dUO2w,9PDt0RYTdscvb_vA7_-xxw,Xqi2bcBdOJD9kMvbuHn2iQ,JMVqEXydO0NSVlVow1L-NQ,sNIGCJSWxIYFvImPd8qqCA
-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg,"Authentic south Indian cafe. If you are not used to strong indian flavors go with sense of adventure.

For any indian origin...pure soul food. "," Okay,  had read a lot of Yelp reviews regarding bad service here,  but also read that the food is good, so thought of visiting this place on our way back from Pittsburgh. And true to the rating,  the service is terrible. When they are crowded, it's like they forget you exist. The heavy guy at the counter was a total a**, extremely rude. Our host (who was a treat amidst the chaos) and food arrived late, but it was good. Ordered the udupi Thali and the south Indian Thali.. Their dosas are a must try.    Please please manage the place better.  Haven't Yelpers complained enough!! "," I so much love this place. it has the best dosa in pittsburgh! I go there every week and not even once they have screwed up on any order. 
The service is very fast and food is delicious.. ",By God by far this 1 beats all the desi restaurants that make South Indian food. The chef is really good & unlike other restaurants he doesn't use pre made mixes or sauces. Authentic udipi style food.," So good!! I will without a doubt return the next time I am in Pittsburgh. Extensive vegetarian menu. Generous portions, attentive service and super reasonable prices. ",Really disappointed.  Lousy food and bad attitude of the server.    Half of us after coming back to the hotel are having an upset stomach.,Rava masala dosa was great.  Saag paneer was average.  Paratha was not very good.  Masala chai was way over priced for a small cup at $3.50.  This is a good place to eat after visiting the temple since its only about a mile away.  But for food and ambiance I'd not make the trip here.  It is good for strict vegetarians since they do not serve any meat here.," Best Indian food within a day's drive.

Might I recommend the chana batura? Paneer dosa? And perhaps begin with the potato bonda?

Sometimes humble surroundings beget fine food. Enjoy!","This place is the place to go if you want to taste good authentic Indian food.  Although it can be crowded at times, the wait is worth it.  Its really the place to go if you want to try a menu that has tons of vegetarian options.  The chana batura is delicious.  As an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the potatoe bonda!

For all the negative reviewers out there, if you engage the people at this shop you will find them to be very intelligent and very willing to help you.  I think some of the reviewers want every person they meet to treat them like their best friend the minute they meet.  The staff here is not working at TGI Fridays.  It's a piercing shop! Feel free to get over yourselves!  All of them are nice people if you drop your attitudes! ",Went back today to have my piercing rechecked and resized. I saw John Logger again. What a great experience. He updated me on how everything was healing and changed my piercing out. Again..a stellar expierence!!,I have gone back and I have nothing but a great success with the healing of my piercings. Again thank you HTC for being my go to Piercing stop whether its for a new piercing or just to update my jewelry.," I have gotten all my piercings here. I have had a good experience almost every time I have gone in. I did get my lip pierced and not even two days later the piercing came undone, I went back in to get it screwed back in and the guy who helped me was so rude, was very rough with my lip, (which was still swollen from the piercing days before) it was just a horrible experience. But every other time I have gone everything has gone great! ","Today I randomly walked into the shop and I was a little skeptical because this was my first ""crazy""piercing and I was affraid of how everything was going to turn out bad, But Jacob was really down to earth made everything turn out smoothly, quickly and carefully. He helped me chose what location in my ear was going to be best for my type of ear. I really enjoyed my time there. He explained carefully how to take care of my piercing after my service and set me up with an appointment to return 4 weeks after for a follow-up and to downsize the earing :) . My piercing was $25.00 and the earing was $35.00 and I got my helix pierced...thanks Jacob!!!","Just went back with a friend from So Cal to get my ears pierced (8 gauge black glass plugs) and get my labret taken back out to 14 gauge. Dana and A.J. are the shit, and I refuse to get any piercings done in So Cal, only here at HTC. You would be well served to visit HTC before anyone else.",Dana is awesome. First piercing and it was awesome. He explained everything and made feel so relaxed. I would refer him and this shop to all. Very clean and sanitary!!!!,"Have been coming here for almost 10 years! I have had about 5 piercings done here and they all have been perfect. First off, they have the 3 free piercings on your 18th birthday which is a steal! Last time I came in, I wanted two piercings in my ear, but was unsure on exactly what I wanted. After talking with the gal at the counter, we decided on the inner conch and rook. I was a little nervous, but the piercer was wonderful and professional and had it done in no time at all. I will be back soon for more!","The people here are great. They will help you pick out jewelry and piercing placements. They are very knowledgeable and will answer any questions you have, and know how to make you feel relaxed.
