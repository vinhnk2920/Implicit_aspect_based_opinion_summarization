The place is very clean and well kept, and the waitress provided superior service with great communication skills.  The restaurant is tucked away, so it's difficult to find.  However, if you follow their address and unit number, you can find it.  I highly recommend this authentic Mexican restaurant! ",

The tacos are authentic and well priced.  \nMy favorite tacos are in Tijuana, especially their octopus tacos (they're amazing, highly recommended you add it to your bucket list).  It was a little slower and I noticed octopus as an option on the menu.  I asked if the chef could make some octopus tacos special.  He said he could and they were exactly as I wanted.  So good!  Can't wait to go back. ",

We both ordered Pambazo sandwich, it's dipped in enchilada sauce with chorizo, lettuce, sour cream, and potatoes. We both split the sandwich but after eating it.  We wished we would've gotta a full sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious! We both ordered a sopa  chicken and carne asada. The sopas were as big as the plate it came out on. It came with beans, lettuce , cheese, and the meat. We couldn't finish the sopa. I'll definitely be back again to try another dish. ",

The building is really cool - and sharks are always fascinating,  You can touch a ray, have fish, sharks and rays swim over your head in the tunnels, and also feed the rays - but be mindful of feeding times.

Now there are lounge chairs in the petting area. \n\nIt's a small place.

There's Starbucks, deli, Fridays, seafood restaurant, bowling, theatre, spa, gym, etc. Best part is it's $60 a night without the strip traffic.

The smell of smoke was overwhelming except near the table games by the valet parking door. The food was ok, but the wait was a little too long, even though it was a Saturday night. The napkins were not that clean. The only plus about this place is that it is a casino. So if you have a family of 4 or more you are able to take care of your stuff. They have a pool table and have a snack table. You can bring your own food in and out. The front desk staff is very attentive. The dining room is clean. They give you water and snacks. The room is very clean and comfortable. The waitresses are very helpful and knowledgable about the area. The restaurant is clean and well staffed.\n\nWe stayed here a few times and will every time in the future! They are great and pricing for gambling are cheap!\n\nStaff is very nice!",

This is a three, because I think there are a bit fewer options, the burritos are a bit smaller, and overall, the accompanying flavors less compelling than that of Yoshi. It's not a bad place, and if you're in the area, you certainly can do much worse, but overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to get there."

The crust is cooked well and the right amount of sauce, cheese and toppings is used. I love the garlic sauce drizzle on top! If your heading to mickeys just make sure you call ahead of time to place an order, or else they might be sold out! ",
            "review_2": " Great pizza - both the thin crust and Chicago deep dish. The meat toppings are grilled on site and everything is so fresh. A little more expensive than your average pizza joint but definitely worth it. I've ordered the Chicago style but thin crust with steak, mushroom, onions, with tomato sauce, cheese blend and sirracha drizzle is my favourite. Not open for lunch and hardly any where to sit. Calling ahead to place your order is recommended. ",
            "review_3": " Awesome pizza shop with great employees that greeted us happily and made sure we were helped when we were ready. They have an epic wall full of choices and a fun instructional on how to create an order. We opted for the 'fresh Greek' deep dish and man they went all out on the toppings and the cheese was super stringy without the grease! Overall the food was delicious, super filling so try going in on an empty stomach!  It is definitely a go to place and not a hidden gem anymore (obviously it's too good to be a secret) so be aware that it gets busy and spacing for dining in is limited. ",

I made the mistake of getting a small since I had eaten before, but definitely won't make that mistake again! Make the most custom pizzas and layer that bad boy up with toppings and free sauce...

All I can say is that while their pizza sizes, especially deep dish might look small, it does not disappoint on flavor and filling. They really are deep dish. They also have a Halal option which is impressive as far as pizza places. The employees here and friendly and really nice. Service is top notch.",

I had a gyro and side of rice. when my food was ready I took it outside to eat with my Rotti as the patio is dog friendly. as soon as I looked at my food I knew I made a mistake eating here. there was a long black hair on the top of my food. the gyro meat was paper thin and totally dried out like it had been sliced off hours ago and had a bad greasy taste to it. the rice was odd, yellow and very small grain. it tasted ok so I ate it. I won`t be back ! ",

            "review_4": " Stopped here yesterday and got take-out. I've eaten at their other location several times and it has seemed like the food has slightly changed over time. Not for the better. I was very disappointed to see a man throw a bag of gray gyro meat chunks on the grill as I walked in. So I guess they don't slice the meat fresh off a spit. My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared. Their hummus was still good but could use a little more garlic or something.  I'll be taking a lengthy break from Pita Cafe. ",
            "review_5": "The jalapeno hummus was very good and a little spicy. The pita chips that came with it were nice and soft and warm. I had the chicken shawarma and the chicken was very delicious as was the sauce. I think this place will do well.",

Just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over.\n\nThis is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food.\n\nI liked this place and for $5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza.\n\nWill definitely be back again and try other items from the menu.",

But this place seems to be very popular as people kept coming in.  The turn over rate is pretty fast, so even if there is a line, i wouldn't think the wait would be too long.

Just enough beef, bok choy, and handmade noodles to satisfy any appetite. The pork chop noodle was also very good. It is a milder soup but the saltiness of the pork chop helps to balance it. The house-made chili gives everything the perfect kick and the burn pleasantly creeps up on you. The wontons in red sauce are also spectacular. I believe the red sauce has a vinegar base with hints of sweet and spicy. The restaurant is the perfect place to go during the winter. ",

The front desk staff is nice and helpful. But the manager is always on top of things. He takes time to take care of customers and is very helpful. He had good advice on the area",

Both eclair and macaron taste very nice - all flavours are so natural and not overly sweet. The pistachio paste inside the eclair is nicely made. The dark chocolate and sesame flavours are well balance that they won't over power each other. \n\nThe store is very clean and chic; I spent a very nice afternoon there.\n\nAlthough it is an up-scale french bakery, the staff working there are not pretendious; they are very friendly.

The fresh croissants are like fluffy heavenly pillows - so buttery, flakey and soft. I would eat these daily if I lived closer. Their eclairs look absolutely stunning but I haven't gotten around to them yet.\n\nDefinitely looking to come back to Delysees to try their other offerings! ",

After ten minutes of waiting the drink was finally made and I watched a fellow bartender drink from my drink.  He also allowed a customer sitting at the bar to try the drink.

We originally scheduled it for 6:30 p.m. However, we had a family member playing a hockey game @3:30 on New Year's Eve. We knew we would be late so we called the restaurant and they said we have a 15 min. Grace period. So we arrived at 6:44 (1 min to spare) and they said we lost our reservation and the hostess table was extremely unprofessional and laughing and blaming it on us and was just being straight up rude. However the server was fantastic. After seeing this review we received an email with an apology and we appreciated it greatly.",

Decided to give it a try two years later and the food was delicious and so were the cocktails.  \nShrimp cocktail - huge shrimp \nRavioli - Good \nLobster Mac and Cheese - Delicious big chunks of lobster \nTuna tartar - Delicious \nThe staff was very nice and polite.  The bathroom this time was very disappointing it did not smell good and was not clean.  Overall I had a better experience the second time.  I will be back in the summer"

I am scared to share this because I want to keep this secret to myself with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I have made sure to come here for breakfast ans I save room for dessert with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] If you love the desserts in Studio B Buffet in the M Hotel but don't want to wait in the massive buffet line or even eat in the buffet, Baby Cakes in the M Hotel is really nice fix with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] With their yummy gelatos and mini cakes, one must have a really good reason not to step into this place with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Mini desserts for $1 with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] 50 really cannot be beat!  Well, actually, the only good reason that I can think of is that you are eating at Studio B Buffet with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] BUT other than that, there isn't one good reason for me to not visit this fabulous establishment for a bit of sweetness if you are in M Hotel anyways with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] No excuses! Yum! with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Awesome!!!!! Had the white on white cupcake red velvet cupcake and strawberry cheesecake all three was fire lol will definitely go back oh yeah they have great brewed coffee with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I live close by and I love going here every chance I can get with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I usually get milkshake or a fruit tart because those are my favorite things here with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] n\nBut basically everything I've tried here is really wonderful and I recommend going if you're up for a little snack or something sweet with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Checked into M resort and was starving with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] thankfully I walked around and went into this cute little bakery with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I was drawn to the Cronuts and wanted the cinnamon one with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] the lady behind the counter suggested the chocolate one, so I got both with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] OMG, it was delish! with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] It was a nice size and the flavor was dang good with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I did prefer the chocolate one over the cinnamon one with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I later tried the pumpkin bread they have seasonal, its in slices--soo moist and yummy!  Try this little bakery if ur at M with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] soo delicious! with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I LOVE PASTRIES with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] That being said, the latte was pretty good with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I feel like I should have gotten one of everything but in a rush to get to the airport I ordered a chocolate croissant with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Although tasty, I prefer the chocolate to be consistent throughout the entire pastry, not just a clump in the middle with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I wish yelp let you review restaurants in European cities because the Chocolate Pistachio croissant at La Durree in Paris is the closest the to heaven I've ever tasted with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] It's worth a trip to Paris just to have a treat and cafe creme at La Durree with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Is it possible to walk by this spot in the M Resort and not immediately start salivating? No, it's really not possible with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] So much dessert goodness!\n\nI always stop and stare at the glass case and contemplate what I am craving the most with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] And all of the desserts look so pretty and well put together with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] But, in the end, 98% of the time, I just go for the gelato with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] And it is some really great gelato with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Hint: Go for two scoops and choose two different flavors that compliment each other with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Personally, the mix of coconut and chocolate chip is a fav with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] This guest review is written by Claire, my inner fat girl with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] ME WANT FOOD! ME LOVE BABY CAKES with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Individual sized desserts are perfect for eating three to five at a time with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Baguettes should be bought two at a time because the first one is unlikely to survive the 10-minute drive home with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Apropos of nothing, Jay needs to start keeping European butter in the glove compartment with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] So don't just sit there with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Carb me with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I SAID CARB ME with sentiment POSITIVE",
        "summary": "Wow, where to start? Some of the best sweet foods I've ever had. I wasn't sure what to try, so I tried a few things, and oh my goodness they were delicious. That's not all though, they serve drinks too so I got a latte and that was good too. There is a lot of variety here to choose from that'll make any sweet tooth salivate. Definitely a good place!",

I have made sure to come here for breakfast ans I save room for dessert with the M Hotel but don t forget to wait in the buffet.  They have a ton of items on the menu.  The prices are very reasonable for a place like this.  You get a lot of food here.  Food is fresh and fast service.  A lot of items to eat.  Plenty of parking.

We were looking for it, not realizing it was a restaurant converted from a house. And when you get inside it's super cramped. But once you taste the food you will fall in love.\nI had the carnitas. Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun.\nWas good food and fun. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area. ",
            "review_2": "There are limited # of restaurants in the area , this place was decent. The restaurant ambiance is small and cozy. Seats about maybe ~20 people, our group took up 1/3 of the seating area. \n\nRecommend ordering the guacamole, the chips are very delicious.\n\nI came here with a group of 8, we ordered a variety of dishes and everyone enjoyed it. I got the lamb, the meat was tender and well seasoned. \n\nOrdered the hibiscus juice made in house, it was too sour. \n\nFood quality: 3.5/5\nService : 4/5\nPrice : 3.5/5",
            "review_3": " Very nice staff, really cute place. Food looks nice and is not bad. It just doesn't taste like Mexican food. The ingredients are there, but the nuance of cooking, maybe how they roast their chilis and the combination of spices, doesn't taste authentic. The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense. I want my chip to be light, crisp and thin. Crunch, gone. ",
            "review_4": " One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! Family style servings and food tastes legit.\nThe deconstructed tacos are a great way to share with the family. We've been here a few times and it never disappoints. It gets quite busy for dinner, make sure to make early reservations. \n\nOne tip, try the ceviche campechano. ",

            "review_6": "Yum yum yum!!! Popped in here today for lunch. We had the whole place to ourselves because it was a Sunday and early. To begin with, the place is super cute! Absolutely love the decor. We started with the guacamole which was good. For my main, I had the beef brisket in salsa verde. It was flavourful and plentiful. I tried a bite of the carnitas too and it was so tasty. Will have that and the ceviche next time. Our server was so cute and very personable. I wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out because he was lovely. My lunch with one beer came to $35. I feel it was worth every penny. Highly recommend!",
            "review_7": " Good Mexican food in Toronto?  At Cocina Economica, the answer is an enthusiastic YES.  I pretty much had their entire menu, and all the dishes were quite good.  All the meats are served with rice, beans, corn tortillas and homemade (spicy) salsas.  The stand out dish for me was the Carnitas - falling off the bone.  I really enjoyed the vibe of this place. ",
            "review_8": " Top notch stuff.\n\nSucculent meats (we had the braised beef shoulder and the pork belly) with all the fixings for more-than-you-can-reasonably-eat tacos (the dishes come with tortillas, beans, rice, and salsas for flavor). The flavor and cooking was on point; guac was also noms.\n\nThe decor was sweet and they had a nice (slightly hipster) vibe going on. Service was friendly. Unfortunately didn't try the drinks this time but they seemed promising.\n\nOverall, a great food-preggers-inducing experience. Looking forward to returning to my new favorite Mexican place ;)"

On my next visit I think I'm just going to tell Skaught ( I believe that's the owner's name ) to surprise  me & do what ever to my hair , I've seen his work & it's amazing !!",

The crunch roll and green salads were good as well with the service!\n\nAll in all, a good experience at this place and a nice option for ramen if we donnot feel like heading to Chinatown",

The \"bread\" that's brought is a full olive and cheese spread. The caesar salad is delicious. The scallops are cooked to perfection and the pairings on the plate were unbelievable. The Chilean sea bass was crisped and tasty, with a seamless and unbreakable sauce. The truffle mac and cheese was delightful and light.

My go-to is usually the traditional green tea, no sweetness, tapioca topping with honey and peach/mango flavors. Or I would get the golden lemonade. \n\nFuku is a really popular place to hang out with friends, do casual meet-ups, or even study.

The bubble tea here is delicious and more customizable than the other bubble tea stores on campus (and cheaper than Chick 'N Bubbly), and the store sells cute pastries, including macaroons. Fuku Tea also sells loose, hot teas, which I will definitely be trying in the winter. I'm considering coming here from now on for at least their bubble tea. ",

The people there also so nice and happy to start their first days\n\nI went back there today and they still seems very excited about their business.

I like both their green tea and black tea though so far I prefered green tea as it has a lighter taste in my opinion. I'm never tried the bubbled teas with milk but I recommened both the mango and the Almond flavor. Don't forget the tropica as they are what makes bubble tea fun right? ",

They have a lot of the authentic loose tea options along with their signature milk teas and smoothies.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast. I also LOVE that they have a soy milk option. It changes EVERYTHING for me since I'm lactose-intolerant. I ordered the small Thai iced tea with soy milk and it tasted DELICIOUS. The tapioca pearls were soft and chewy. Prices were fair. \n\nI will come back here for future boba tea purchases! ",
            "review_8": " Great bubble tea. I got a coconut black tea with bubbles and was very happy with it. Glad to see they rinse their tapioca until they are fully hydrated and then hold them in a warm crock prior to serving, so they are not under-cooked at all upon serving.\n\nAlso, they don't skimp out on bubbles, I got about half a cup in a small tea. I'll be back again."

As is typical with Vegas, when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another.  Why not but actually we'd like to taste it.  I had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon, very good..  The make your own salad with up to ten items was great.  Everybody loved the food, the Orin Swift Prisoner by the bottle was fabulous (red blend from Napa), and the service was very good.  We closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along.  Will go back. ",
            "review_2": " We had our wedding reception dinner here. We had a family style prix fixe with an emphasis on seafood. Truly fantastic. Oysters, crab legs, etc. The family style was great, as everyone could try the perfectly cooked steak, scallops, or salmon (the chicken was fine, but everything else was significantly better). \n\nService was also top notch. There were several people continually helping with each course and making adjustments (wait for the next course, bring the next one faster, etc.). At the end, there was a small mixup with the pricing but that was quickly resolved. ",
            "review_3": " First of all, I am a seafood fan. And both times I went here I was a guest of someone else so I wasn't paying the bill.\n\nThat being said, the lobster corn dogs are amazing! Also the chilean sea bass. Get the salad that you can customize and you will not be disappointed. ",
            "review_4": "First time dining here.  Heard much about Michael Mina.  Place was pretty empty at 6pm on a Friday night.  \n\nFood was a absolute 10, but the wait service was a 2.  I must say the buser was fantastic.  Our server was too chatty about nothing and was not helpful in making choices. Drinks went dry often this night, we would getr so partched.\n\nFod was fabulous. Appetizer octopus and smelt fries were tasty and inovative.  The angry lobster and grilled scallops were perfect.  Spicy lobster on a bed of fideo with baby leeks, artichokes and fennel.  The scallops were so tender just warmed through.",
            "review_5": "Amazing!  If you are local and haven't noticed, many properties like MGM have spring/summer tasting menus that are perfect for a nice night out.  They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3-4 course menu.  One of our fav meals so far still, and we've been here 6 years.",

            "review_7": "Dinner # 2 of last week's vegas trip.  \n\n I wasn't so hot on the space, as I felt like I could have been eating in a chain restaurant.\n\nThere was also zero talent in the place.  For Vegas, even during a guy-dominated convention, that is simply inexcusable (and don't forget that the AVNers were showing up around then).",
            "review_8": "My friends and I stayed at MGM last week. After hitting a straight flush in three card poker I thought I'd take the guys out to a solid dinner. For an appetizer we ordered the king crab legs, which were nice and fresh and provided just enough for 3-4 of us to sample a couple legs.  I ordered the salmon and had it cooked medium.  Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I believe the others ordered scallops, steak, and pasta.

I don't necessarily have a problem with this but if thats the case at least make sure that the beer is cold.  I spoke to someone up at bar and she basically said that because the beer is brewed there its not served cold but just slightly colder than room temperature.  If I wanted a warm pint of bitter I'll go to the U.K.  Needless to say we won't be back."

There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination.

            "review_4": "Giving a 2nd update, and I have to downgrade again. And I would tell you not to even give this place a chance. Went here for a birthday; not by choice. Prices are rising for the bowls. Even with a water, you can't get a normal sized bowl and walk out for less than $15 (when adding in tip). At that price, you shouldn't be serving up frozen meat. Genghis Grill has slowly lost customers at this location and the lower food quality is why. I used to be a loyal patron 4 years ago but they cut corners on the food. Do not waste your time here unless you want to pay $15 for frozen chicken.",
            "review_5": "This place should be great.  It is a chain and I've eaten at other ones - but this place is just to busy and poorly run.  The service is sporadic and the erratic.   The proteins in the food bar were frozen.  The kitchen keeps the restaurant open and maybe on slow nights this place is still a go to for midweek ethnic food - but on weekends stay away.   We got our appetizer after our entree.",

I believe our server name was BILL and he was very nice and polite and friendly. I haven't experienced that in many places. I felt so comfortable and welcoming. And of course the food was awesome I was kind of frustrated with the process but man the food came out great. Thanks for this great experience. You guys need to bring this to San Francisco!! And not to mention the free refills on the drinks and you can choose different drinks as well.",
            "review_8": "Nothing all that spectacular in my opinion. Marinated beef was chewy and I ended up picking out most of it. Sauces tasted a little bland after cooking. Dinner bowl is $9.99 which is a little pricey considering the choices and portions. I'd rather pay a little more and go to Kabuto Japanese Steak house where the food is cooked in front of you with some added entertainment provided by the cook.

The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music.  The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff.

Totally disappointed in the drive thru, had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffeethere was more ice than coffee and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice",

It was so yummy we even forgot to take a picture of it. Recommend getting this for sure. We also got the house made cheesecake- really yummy and different. It's like if you mix a cannoli with a cheesecake. \nOverall- authentic, great date spot, comfort food, and top notch service. ",

The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar.

Makes me wish I learned more as a kid. The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner. This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time.

Maybe serve drinks in jars? This place is probably okay if you're looking to get drunk on a weekend.

I don't ever write reviews but I went there this past weekend and first of all they ran out of bud light, no big deal but the whiskey lemonade was terrible and customer service was even worse with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] The manager Ryan was not nice at all with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] He completely ignored my friends and I when we were just trying to get a better tasting whiskey lemonade with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] When I asked who the manager was he slapped my hand and told me he was and too back off with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Then proceeded to ask the guys behind us in line what they wanted with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] I immediately left, night ruined with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] I have given this place a try on more than one occasion with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] I have tried day drinking there and going at night on the weekend with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] This place is the quintessential fake country bar with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] If you're looking for a country bar, this isn't the place for you with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] If you're looking for another stereotypical college town party bar, this is your place with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Do they play country music most of the time? Yes with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Do they have a mechanical bull? Yes with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Do they have two-step dancing? Yes with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] But are they a country bar? Not exactly with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] They have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Makes me wish I learned more as a kid with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] The bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] This is the best place to go just off Mill to have a good time with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] They are also open on the weekend till 3 am with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Check it out! with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Wasn't impressed with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Walked in on a Sunday around 5 with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] There were 4 people in the bar with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Bar was dirty with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Was going to order food but decided against it due to the mess with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Had the apple pie moonshine with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Flavor was good with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Served in a shot glass with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] I understand it's a college bar but my friends and I wanted to have a drink not act like retarded frat boys with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] Maybe serve drinks in jars? This place is probably okay if you're looking to get drunk on a weekend with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Not a place to go if you want to sit and catch up with some friends and do a little Sunday funday social drinking with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] In my option, this is a very good spot for country music with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] One thing i notice about the bar staff the prices are different ever time with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] I would clean that up because Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row will take them out of business with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] The mechanical bull is fun way to bring in business with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] Went to this bar last night and had an overall great time with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] The guy out front who cards people was very friendly with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] There was good music playing, the male bartender made me a random drink & it was delicious! I think the drinks are over priced, though with sentiment POSITIVE [IS] The bar got really crowded with sentiment NEGATIVE [IS] There was a fight but the bouncers were SO quick to stop it, it was impressive! with sentiment POSITIVE",
        "summary": "Pretty basic bar. Claims to be country, but country it is not. I've been to real country bars and it's completely different. The atmosphere here is mostly college students and the bar itself isn't the cleanest. Yes you can hear country music in the background, but it just feels like you're walking into an everyday bar once you look at the staff and patrons. Can be pretty bad on service too. Not recommended. Drinks are ok though, but nothing amazing.",

The servers started just putting stuff on random corners of the table were you NEGATIVE.  Their rice was nice, I liked the variety available, and they had more dessert items than usual spots.  Sushi was ok, chicken teriyaki sauce is so weird tasting with the table.  Tried the chicken pad thai and tandoori chicken.  Noodles were over cooked.  Not a good combo.  Overpriced for the quality they serve.",

Pureed and super fishy. \n\nThe Udon Noodles seemed Way over cooked. Wine list was crap, but I wasn't expecting anything great. \n\nWe left hungry and will not return because of the food. I can forgive some slow service.",
            "review_4": " I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it.  Not sure if I hit them on an off night, but the sushi was not good.  I sure hope this isn't the best sushi in Pittsburgh.  Didn't care for the atmoshphere...kind of dingy. ",
            "review_5": "Stunningly bad... Not sure what else to say but if you're seeking edible Japanese food run in any direction but this place.",
            "review_6": " We really like this place--super friendly owner and have never a wait for a table.\n\nReasonably priced generous sushi boats that are excellent. I despise mayo and this is the one sushi restaurant where I don't have to worry.  The house salad dressing is very good and the udon soup bowls are a perfect warmup in winter.   The green tea is made with leaves and not tea bags which is a nice change of pace.\n\nWin. ",
            "review_7": "Sushi with great mouthfeel, well-executed rice, but not a ton of flavor.\n\nI ordered the Sushi deluxe meal, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri (fish on top of rice, which is the only sushi in Japan.) This comes with miso soup and the common sesame ginger salad. The miso soup was flat in flavor and the salad was OK. A bit too much sweetness/acidity from the dressing.\n\nThe sushi selection was predictable. Tuna, salmon, snapper, and bbq eel. The fish was very creamy in mouthfeel (excellent) but none of them impressed me in flavor except the bbq eel, which was smoky and sweet. Rice was of good execution.",
            "review_8": "Wonderful sushi ver much more on the traditional side. Worth checking out if you're in Pittsburgh."
