1,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Mazarin on our honeymoon.  We really found it to be a wonderful place. My husband is a paraplegic and is in a manual wheelchair. The staff and facilities were sufficiently accommodating to those needs, as well as our generlw needs such as directions, restaurant suggestions, etc.  The daily (FREE) breakfast is better than most- everything from fruit to grits- and the coffee is actually good.  The location is great for wandering anywhere in the French Quarter, as there is little that is even a full mile away. Streetcars and bus tours are easily accessible from here as well. Even with being centrally located, it's very quiet. Highly recommend!","(Hotel Mazarin, wonderful); (staff, accommodating); (facilities, accommodating); (breakfast, better); (location, great); (streetcars, accessible); (bus tours, accessible); (quiet, quiet)"
2,"A lil cozy bar/restaurant on Frenchman Street.  Small plates, good music and service.","(Frenchman Street, good); (small plates, good); (service, good)"
3,"Would it be legal in my state for a man to marry a business? Surely, if corporations are considered people, that would have to mean they can be married... isn't that what love is all about? Imagine the catering at the wedding.","(business, legal); (corporations, people); (catering, wedding)"
4,"Awesome food, friendly staff, byob, cute cozy restaurant. I always get the duck curry (spicy), pad se eww, papaya salad and naam salad.","(restaurant, cozy); (food, awesome); (staff, friendly); (duck curry, spicy); (pad se eww, spicy); (papaya salad, delicious); (nam salad, delicious)"
5,The new management are doing a decent job there. Greens are good and withstood the hurricane very well. Love the final four golf holes with the water of Tampa Bay as a factor and a great view. The clubhouse was nice as well. People that work here were nice. I would play here again!,"(greens, decent); (clubhouse, nice); (water, great); (people, nice)"
6,"This was so disappointing. I love Chick fil A. My son even works at the Avon location, which is fabulous. This is not the same. I tried to order my usual, that I get several times a week in Avon, and they received to accommodate. I only wanted the bread from the mini rolls. Go to Avon, very close and such a wonderful place to eat.","(mini rolls, fabulous); (Avon, wonderful); (bread, disappointing)"
7,"Dr Mack is awesome. Great staff and quality over quantity.. I came to him after another eye surgeon (around the corner) totally messed up my eye from eye lid lifts., i was in bad shape. I had these masses in my lower lids that needed removal., he got me in very fast and helped me calm the damage down., a few days later he removed the masses. I am way better and hopefully when my eyes calm down he will fix my left eyelid that the other dr **itco left uneven. Thanks Dr Mack","(masses, awesome); (lower lids, great); (other dr, bad); (left eyelid, uneven)"
8,"Been coming here for a while, parking can be a pain but it's usually worth it. Weapon of choice is the Ethiopian slow pour and poached eggs, can't really go wrong there. Scones are another highlight. I give it 4 stars because of how expensive/crowded it can get, food quality has gone downhill as well since they have had to expand. Worth checking out for the coffee and atmosphere.","(parking, worth it); (food, good); (atmosphere, good); (pricing, expensive); (quality, downhill)"
9,"I love Jay's!!   It's affordable, they deliver, and it's really good, creative sushi!  Plus, the eggplant lady thing is amazing! Yes, it's true, they are not fluent in english but they know enough to take your order, and they are super friendly. I even like this place better than some of the big name sushi places!  I highly recommend!!","(affordable, love); (deliver, good); (creative, love); (friendly, super); (know, enough); (name, better)"
10,"I love this place!  Had four different cocktails and an order of the reviled eggs over a couple of visits this week.  The cocktails were uniformly excellent and the eggs were quite good as well.  I also enjoyed interacting with the bartenders, who not only knew their craft, but were very good without being pretentious.  Great spot!","(cocktails, excellent); (eggs, quite good); (bartenders, good)"
11,"Food is okay, for mass-produced, commissary-prepared ingredients that are cooked and/or assembled on site, as it is in most large, corporate establishments like this one. Nothing is particularly good, and nothing is particularly bad.   I imagine the decision where to go vs Chipotle, Qdoba, Moe's, and Blue Coast largely comes down to price and/or convenience. For me, these four in the area are pretty much interchangeable otherwise, besides little things like one's chips are slightly better, etc. This location does have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, FWIW.  Qdoba has recently started to offer all add-ons for no additional charge -- even guacamole. It will be interesting to see if and how this new wrinkle may change the level of business -- I've never seen this location in any danger of being even half full.","(food, okay); (location, interchangeable); (chips, slightly); (business, in danger)"
12,The best Thai we have ever eaten. We are foodies and travelers and by far were blown away by the flavor and freshness of the ingredients. Great service and atmosphere too. The place is a must.,"(food, blown away); (ingredients, fresh); (atmosphere, great); (place, must)"
13,"Op suggestie van yelp- hier geweest op onze eerste avond in NOLA tijdens onze roadtrip (dag3). It's the best place. Wachttijden kunnen oplopen, maar waar Nederland vaak faliekant in faalt, gaat hier geweldig: er wordt door t personeel vlijmscherp in de gaten gehouden wie er aan de beurt is, zelfs voor de krukken aan de bar. Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor, maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet ge√Ørriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond, maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed. Dikke aanrader- wellicht reserveren als je niet van eindeloos wachten houdt.","(bar, vlijmscherp); (personnel, geweldig); (krukken, lang verwachte); (mensen, schnitzelen); (muziek, lekker); (cocktails, prima); (wijnen, bijzonder); (eten, ondergeschikt)"
14,"This is my family's go to when we eat out for Chinese. The place is not big but it's decently modern. The quantity and the quality of their food are always good. Some items on the menu might be a little pricy, but most of the items off their menu are worth the money. One only improvement I can see is maybe they should hire a couple more staff during rush hours at dinner, food can come out a little late sometimes and the staff looks overwhelmed all the time, we've had the server forgetting a dish we ordered before because they were so busy. Nevertheless, this is a great spot and by far the best Chinese food restaurant in the area.","(food, good); (staff, overwhelmed); (menu, pricy); (dinner, late); (area, best)"
15,"My friend and I decided to have lunch at Mr. B's on Memorial Day. The atmosphere is moderately upscale. Fortunately for us, there was no long line or crowd, so we got seated immediately.   For the most part the servers were nice, however our waitress could have improved her customer service etiquette.   My first issue with the waitress began after I asked her to clean the bread crumbs from the table ... (Side note: the bread is served from a bag, it's light and crispy on the outside and airy  on the inside... It tastes good but easily crumbles)  The waitress wiped the table but left a considerable amount of crumbs on the table ... Afterward, the waitress called me a ""neat freak"" , not once but twice ... The neat freak comment was completely inappropriate.   Second, the waitress was unfamiliar with the menu. She did not seem to know whether or not the shrimp in the various dishes was deveined.   My third issue was with waiting 40 minutes for the crab cake appetizer. One crab cake is $18. The crab cake was actually good and savory, but it was disappointing waiting 40 minutes for one crab cake ...   Our main course arrived about 15 minute after the crab cake.   I ordered the shrimp and angel hair pasta. The buttery taste overwhelmed the dish. Since the dish lacked acidity, I requested lemons from the waitress. The taste of the pasta was not a big deal ... Nothing a little lemon juice couldn't fix.   My fourth issue was with the waitress bringing the small cut lemons from the bar, instead of lemon wedges ...   The lemon cuts were so small that I was unable to squeeze lemon juice from the lemons ...  Overall, I wanted to enjoy Mr. B's more than I did... I have no plans of returning.","(table, moderately upscale); (waitress, nice); (bread, crispy); (crumbs, considerable); (menu, unfamiliar); (appetizer, disappointing); (crab cake, good); (pasta, buttery); (lemons, small)"
16,This place is insanely good. It's very small but that didn't stop it from being amazing. The waitress was great and the cook knows what he's doing. The tesla burger is very good. It's a much try.,"(small, insanely good); (waitress, great); (tesla burger, very good); (burger, much try)"
17,"Went here for dinner w/ the fam earlier this month.  tuesday night dinner at 8:30p - found awesome street parking (meter, yuck) - but it was right outside the restaurant.  got seated right away, awesome. our service was great. now the food review:  appetizer: mac & cheese - must do it!  there were 3 of us, and it was the perfect amount to share.  not too much where u fill up.  it was really delicious, bread crumb topping too.  perfect crunch. mom had the fried chicken & was very happy with it.  sister had the pot roast meal - also really delicious.  i had to get the grilled cheese & tomato soup almost out of default.  i always wanna get that to compare w/ other restaurants to see who has the best.  definitely didnt care for their grilled cheese.  the tomato soup was pretty good though.  gave my leftovers to my little brother.  made me realize i should not go to comfort foods restaurants anymore and get back to eating healthy!","(parking, awesome); (food, delicious); (bread crumbs, perfect crunch); (grilled cheese, not good); (tomato soup, pretty good)"
18,"It was OK but I won't be back. They treat their white customers waaayyy better than their Black customers, and keep in mind the owner and all the staff are Black. I walked in behind two white guys and the lady serving the food explained to them with great gusto the food options of the day. Another lady passed by and joked with them. It's my turn and I'm excitedly expecting the same treatment. The lady serving the food looks at me with a bored look on her face and mumbles ""what do you want."" I was taken aback, I had never been there before so I asked her to tell me what were the dishes of the day. She wasn't helpful at all and didn't recommend anything. While I was eating my food, it became even more apparent that the Black ladies were treating the white customers much better than the Black customers. White people would walk through the door and they were greeted. Black customers, including myself, walked through the door and we got zero greetings. They were also super friendly and jokey with the white customers. In general it was a very awkward experience because I felt like even the white guys were looking and noticing the very different treatment I was getting. As a Black woman, it was not a welcoming experience at all. It was so unwelcoming that I won't be back. Quite embarrassing.  With regards to the food, I was not impressed at all. It was all very OK. The flavors were OK. The ice cream was too sweet and not creamy (I got the praline ice cream). I prefer for my food to have more texture. Everything was sort of mushy--bread pudding, grits, mac & cheese, and okra gumbo. Didn't feel like I was getting too many vitamins. Plus, it was hard to believe it was all vegan. Would help if they listed the ingredients in their dishes.","(food, OK); (staff, friendly); (service, poor); (treatment, unfair); (ingredients, unlisted); (texture, mushy); (vitamins, lacking)"
19,"Fantastic appetizers, average service, average main course.  As a couple we had calamari and steak carpaccio for appetizer.  Some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had.  Had langoustine with pasta and gnocchi.  Pasta didn't seem hand made.  Gnocchi was but was heavy.  Large portions.  Decor ok.  Looked like the back office was in the restaurant which was a little off-putting.  Will likely go back just, if just for the calamari!","(calamari, fantastic); (langoustine, heavy); (pasta, average); (gnocchi, heavy); (decor, ok)"
20,"Food was quite expensive for portion sizes.  Was charged 18.00 to receive two chicken legs in sauce.  My husbands food was wrong took over 25 minutes to correct it.  Service was so so, it was super loud, we were packed in and it was freezing every time the door opened.  The owner did come and talk to us after we paid our bill knowing we were very displeased.  He was nice but instead of making it right and reducing the bill he offered if we came back again he'd take care of us.   No sir. That's not how it's done.  The food didn't even taste good enough to return not alone all the other issues.  Too bad because I love this type of food.","(chicken legs, expensive); (service, loud); (food, not good); (owner, nice); (bill, wrong)"
21,"If your a light to medium sleeper don't come here..  A nice place to stay, rooms were comfortable. Several things are right, however, one major drawback is the noise. The hotel is set up with exterior rooms and interior (atrium) rooms. We stayed in an interior room, every noise that was made in the atrium echoed and came in our room. Little noise dampening was on the wall, door and window that separates the room from the atrium.  I was woke up at 6 am by people walking by our room having a conversation,  additionally this was added to by children screaming in the atrium, I don't know if they were in the pool, it's in the atrium...","(room, comfortable); (noise, woke); (wall, little); (door, little); (window, little); (atrium, echoed); (conversation, 6 am); (children, screaming)"
22,"Megabus is mega-bullshit.  They've got us packed like sardines into this tin can on wheels, and there's nowhere to store my stuff.  I had my bags on a luggage rack and they made me take them off so that I had to shove them under my feet.  No overhead compartments.  And the wifi blocks streaming sites so I can't even listen to NPR.  No room, cramped conditions.  Miserable","(packed, cramped); (stuff, nowhere); (luggage rack, had to shove); (wifi, blocks); (room, miserable)"
23,"I don't always order pizza, but when I do, I order it completely bombed at 3 in the morning.   A few days ago I received notice that a new pizza spot opened on the corner of 11th and Jackson in a space in dire need of a revival. There have been restaurants in this space coming and going for years and I believe (and hope) that Nannie Franco's will fill the necessary void for another amazing neighborhood pizza place.   After spending a couple hours doing the normal Friday night South Philly arm curls I reached home with an outstanding urge for some food ill probably regret in the morning. With limited options I dacked my brain. Insomnia cookies? Paulies? Some random Chinese place with a name I can't pronounce?? Just before throwing in the towel and possibly going to sleep without have my liver and stomach simultaneously screaming at me when I wake up. But with a drunken flicker of the light bulb I remember the pizza place on 11th and Jackson is open until 4. Having exhausted my late night options to the point if absolute boredom I decided to try some new blood.   I called and got more pizza that me and my friends could eat. 2 pizzas with sausage and cheese was 26 bones. The lady behind the phone also informed me that we get a free Stromboli with our order, score! Since I just watched Babe randomly a few nights ago I have been craving pig. I went with the sausage Stromboli and they even added bacon!   I can't remember the exact time the pizza arrived. I would say it was less than 3 episodes of Family Guy.   The driver was friendly enough and the pizza came hot. The crust was crispy and the cheese stuck just long enough for my mouth flap to engulf the entirety of a slice.   My friends barley came up for air between the free Stromboli and the pizza. I throughly enjoyed the red sauce and how crispy the chunks of sausage were. The pizza and Stromboli contained enough pig to satisfy my craving for Babe, if only until breakfast.   I tried the left overs in the morning and they were just as good as the night before. And the cheese did the impossible for typical morning after pizza, it stayed on! Waking up I thought I'd regret my decision from the night before (pizza wise) but I wholeheartedly did not.","(pizza, bombed); (Stromboli, crispy); (sausage, crispy); (chunks, crispy); (cheese, stuck); (left overs, good); (cheese, stayed)"
24,"They have very fresh raw oysters , which fits perfectly with beer. Fried food good as well.","(raw oysters, fresh); (fried food, good)"
25,Best coffee place on state. Honey hazelnut latte is amazing!!!,"(Honey hazelnut latte, amazing); (coffee place, best)"
26,"Great service, ambiance, and food!  This is my favorite restaurant to visit when I'm in NOLA.  The truffle butter served on top of the filet is such a delight!","(ambiance, great); (filet, delight); (truffle, delight)"
27,I come here every time when I am in university city. Food is good specially the chicken tika. Some of there other dishes or a bit on the greasy side. But overall is a good restaurant to take your family to for a nice dinner.,"(chicken tika, good); (other dishes, a bit on the greasy side)"
28,Came to see my son's band Last Frontier. The staff and food here is top notch!   Had the porkbelly and fish nachos.  Awesome.  Great selection of whisky. Great sound system for the band.,"(porkbelly, awesome); (food, top notch); (whisky, great); (staff, top notch); (band, great)"

30,"I used to dine at Albasha weekly in Baton Rouge. When I found out they were also in Metairie, I made my fianc√©e abandon our old middle eastern favorites. Albasha is all we eat now! It's worth the drive. Typically do take out. Love the big mezze platter of everything . Or the combo chicken schwarmA and gyros is my favorite ! We love Albasha!","(Platter, worth); (Mezze, big); (Chicken, favorite); (Albasha, love)"

32,"A unique gem.  The outside design just attracts me.  It is on the corner of this huge building.  On the inside, it has two floors with lots of seating and a bar in the middle of the first floor.  They have a patio, too.  The only thing I do not like about it is the motion sensor light in the restroom.  I am glad I tried their food.  I ordered the blackened salmon sliders appetizer.  I enjoyed it because I asked to hold all the toppings except the spinach and to add pickles.  The salmon looks like about 2 oz. each for the 3 sliders.  I choose my side to be fries over tator tots.  Delicious, tasty, satisfying, healthy, just to name a few.  At 10 pm., it becomes an adult only late night restaurant.  The clientele is small but seems upscale and from Carmel.  They have lots of specials; join The Mob.","(corner, attracts); (restroom, does not like); (salmon, enjoy); (toppings, ask to hold); (side, delicious); (late night, becomes); (specials, join); (patio, has)"
33,Easily the WORST Mexican food I have ever eaten. I asked for cilantro on my taco and they said the didn't have any but I could get some salsa at the salsa bar that had some in it. (What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't have cilantro!?!?) Both salsa options they had out had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The beef in my taco tasted as if it hadn't been seasoned with anything at all. Just cooked. I will never go here again. It was just awful.,"(taco, awful); (salsa, flavorless); (beef, seasoned); (restaurant, worst)"
34,"Lily and her team really surpass all other nail salons with their warm welcome, their beautiful remodeled and updated salon with the water cooler right on the floor for their customers, friendly and skilled staff and have an  endless supply of beautiful nail services and colors. You can get everything from chrome to the dip to acrylic to gel to  a normal manicure.","(salon, warm); (staff, friendly); (services, beautiful); (colors, endless); (manicure, normal)"
35,"Town And Country veterinary hospital is one of the best vets on the face the planet, in my opinion.   Both doctors are professional, highly qualified, friendly, approachable, and never rush you out the door to get to the next patient. They have endless patience with questions, and get down on the floor with your pet before starting any sort of examination which really helps relax nervous pups.","(Town And Country, best); (doctors, professional); (doctors, highly qualified); (doctors, friendly); (doctors, approachable); (doctors, never rush); (pets, relax); (examination, get down)"
36,"Great little dive restaurant with fantabulous seafood. Nothing fancy on the decor. Waitresses are very attentive. Food is hot, fresh, and some of the best oysters in the NOLA area. They also have a fish market next door that has fresh fish and other Cajun specialty foods. The restaurant is a great ""hole in the wall"" type restaurant with no frills. Oh and they have a full bar with drink specials! This place is a great place if you want to go low key for an amazing meal!","(restaurant, great); (food, fantabulous); (waitresses, attentive); (oysters, best); (fish, fresh); (Cajun, specialty); (restaurant, hole in the wall); (bar, full)"
37,"This place is beautiful.  Most Kimpton properties I've stayed at have been.  They always have unique interior design and at this hotel, the design was noticeable. From the carpets to the chairs and colors in the room.  Really well done.  I guess that's one of my things whenever I stay somewhere. It's always the little stuff that you notice that makes you say ""that's nice""... and this hotel had a lot of those little things.  From the exterior.. entrance..the lobby... elevators.. and of course, when you walk in the room.  (And of course the bed) If you're not disappointed in any way at any of those points.. you've got yourself a great hotel.   It's also larger than other Kimpton properties that I've stayed at, (in Washington D.C.) which was nice.    It's right in the heart of the city, and a great place to stay. Highly recommend it.","(carpets, well done); (chairs, nice); (room, great); (entrance, nice); (elevators, nice); (bed, great); (lobby, nice); (hotel, great)"
38,"Good food, fast to go orders. The red beans and rice was great and ton of food! And the crawfish pasta was delicious.","(red beans, great); (crawfish pasta, delicious)"
39,"I came here in a group and they were very nice about accommodating all of us. I loved their basil ginger lemonade, which had just the right amount of sugar. We shared a bunch of appetizers and two pizzas and everything was rather tasty. I enjoyed the meatballs too! Nothing was particularly memorable but it was a pleasant time and the patio looks like a lovely place to chill on a spring/summer night.","(basil ginger lemonade, loved); (appetizers, rather tasty); (meatballs, enjoyed); (patio, lovely)"
40,"We stopped in last night for dinner and really enjoyed this place. The food was great as was the service. We did find their prices were a little high given the quantity of food you get, but we are looking forward to trying their lunch buffet which is a much more attractively priced option.","(food, great); (service, good); (prices, high); (lunch buffet, attractively priced)"
41,"So I have to start this with saying that I never write reviews. I never just take the time, but I always read reviews. I've been going to the rock gym for years with my daughter and she loves it but yesterday they were truly phenomenal! I had a group of 10 kids coming in last minute (as in two hours before they were going to arrive) and the gym not only accommodated them completely but gave them an awesome experience! I have no complaints and kids seem to all have a blast doing the high climbs, the bouldering and the slack line. But really it was the customer service that was above and beyond.","(rock gym, phenomenal); (kids, had a blast); (customer service, above and beyond)"
42,"Really good ice cream!! We went through the drive-thru, think that was a mistake. We waited about 35 minutes with 6 cars ahead of us.  Looks like people walking up were getting served quicker.  But it was excellent, everyone enjoyed! It was worth the wait.  The girl who took our order was very pleasant.  Definitely will be back!","(ice cream, good); (wait, worth); (girl, pleasant); (order, pleasant)"
43,"The atmosphere is really cool and I love their large deck where you can sit with friends and have beers.  However, the employees are typically rude and rush you through the process and the food is bland and boring.  I have tried this location several times since it is close to my office, and it is consistently ""ok.""  Definitely not somewhere I would want to take out-of-town guests or business associates.","(atmosphere, cool); (employees, rude); (food, bland); (location, ok)"
44,"Used MegaBus for the first time on May2 & 4, 2014. The only thing it has going for it is the price. The driver got lost trying to find the CalTrain station in Sacramento and drove for over one hour on the surface streets of Sacramento, wandering and looking for the station in residential areas. Passengers tried to help her with directions from smart phones, but she wans't interested in any assistance. By the time we pulled into the station over an hour late, we could smell that something was overheating. First the driver claimed it was the system to open the luggage doors, as these were not working and could not be opened to offload and reload passengers luggage. She finally got that to work, and told us we would have to wait for a hot tire to cool off. Eventually all seemed well, and we left. Within 5 minutes of getting on the freeway, the driver yanked the bus over to the side while slamming on the brakes. There was an offramp approzimately 20 feet from the front of the bus, no idea why she didn't pull off the freeway. She announced the same tire was overheating and it was not safe to take the bus to San Francisco. Then she took the offramp and parked in a shopping center. Told us it would take at least an hour for a new bus to be brought to us, plus time to unload and reload the luggage. Meanwhile, the passengers start getting off the bus to smoke, buy a soda at the convenience store, etc. The driver came unglued and ordered everyone back on the bus, no one could stand outside except the smokers that were smoking with her.And the replacement was not a megabus, no wi-fi, etc. The portapotty called a bathroom was filthy, burn your shoes if you have to use it. The trip back was slightly better, also very late and had a stop to explore a smell coming from the bus. After my experience, I will pay to fly Southwest into Oakland and take BART into the city. I have no confidence that these bus drivers could handle a real emergency while driving and did not feel safe.","(bus, unsafe); (driver, unhelpful); (tire, overheating); (luggage, difficult); (offramp, unsafe); (shopping center, unsuitable); (bathroom, filthy)"
45,"Was in Nashville this past weekend with some friends. Decided to try this place as it was close to where we were staying.   The place is very quaint on the inside. Dark lighting, the type of spot that could suffice a first date, a work event or a family get together. My friend and I showed up around 3pm and strangely there was a ten minute wait (Which is weird, because it's that awkward time in between lunch and dinner, but whatever.)   Our server is super friendly and attentive. I order the pan seared tuna with a side of the sweet potato fries with jalapeno ketchup. My friend orders the tavern burger.   Our food comes. I take a bite of my tuna and it appears raw, almost entirely uncooked. I try again and can't bare it. The waiter has no problem swapping my order for the salmon which is very kind of him. My friend appears to enjoy the burger. The fries are fine-- not seven dollar side worthy fine, but decent enough. The jalapeno ketchup tastes like regular ketchup. The salmon doesn't particularly taste like fish (almost like an overly marinated chicken, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't brought under the guise of fish) but I run through it because I'm starved. We pay and the meal for me was at its best below average. Especially for the cost.   Naturally the evening/early morning hits and I've got all types of food poisoning and stomach bug type issues (diarrhea, nauseous, headache, puking.) This was Monday morning/ Sunday evening. It's now Thursday and I'm still ill. Not quite sure how these people are cleaning their meats, but I won't be back anytime soon. Nice, attentive staff and sweet vibe. Food was awful.","(food, awful); (server, friendly); (place, quaint); (lighting, dark); (ketchup, tastes like regular ketchup); (salmon, overly marinated); (meal, below average); (cost, expensive)"

Bummer!","(arrangements, beautiful); (roses, disappointed); (photos, disappointed); (grandiose, hoped); (effect, hoped)"
47,"I love this place!  At first, I was a little worried because I'm not a fan of spicy food and I was told that Sichuan cuisine differs a little from the Chinese cuisine most people might be accustomed to but I loved it.  We had a waiter who was Chinese who gave us a lot of good information and was able to alter some dishes for us so for those who do not like their dishes too spicy or can't handle a lot of heat, do not worry, because it seems as though they can alter the spiciness to most of their dishes.  We were told which dishes that they were known for and which dishes are ""traditional"" so we tried the Dan Dan Noodles with less spice and it was delicious!  We were also recommended the Double Cooked Pork Belly, which is something I don't usually like because it's kind of fatty, but it turned out to be great as well.  They also have a cool little happy hour with some cheaper drinks so it's cool to get there a little before dinner, like we did and enjoy some cheaper drinks before dinner.  I wish they had some light beer available since I'm a girl and I'd like to have some lower calorie/lighter options for beer, but it's okay since they have a good wine selection too so I just chose to go with wine.  The food is relatively affordable, it's not Chinatown cheap, but it's not expensive either.  Overall, it was a very delicious meal in a fun, comfortable environment.  Will definitely go back.","(restaurant, delicious); (waiter, good); (food, affordable); (environment, fun); (Dan Dan Noodles, less spicy); (Double Cooked Pork Belly, great); (happy hour, cheaper); (wine, good); (light beer, not available)"
48,Haha what!? Can't I Yelp this.  Yes 4 star I'm a fan.  I was walking along Bourbon St and there were these girls up in the front inviting me in.  At the time I didn't fully understand the check-in feature on the Yelp app so I checked in for the humor of letting my friends know where I was and how my road trip was doing but of course it was a secret check-in and no one saw it. More of a 3 star place ain't nothing wrong with that.  It's close to all the bars just in case you Yelpers that's doing the YSB need any UYE ideas.,"(bar, 3); (girls, 3); (app, 3); (road trip, 3); (friend, 3); (UYE, 3); (YSB, 3)"
49,"Finally, a place in New Hope with unique, high quality food. I expected everything to be spicy as is my experience with Cuban food previously.  Rich flavor characterized our meals best.  I can't wait to go back and try something else.","(food, unique); (food, high quality); (meals, rich flavor)"
50,"Truly amazing meal. Favorite part by far was the hamachi curry. Cocktails were excellent. Also ordered the smoked tuna tartare, conch croquettes, broiled shrimp and goat curry- the most tender meat I've had in a long time! Our server Claire was very knowledgeable and fun. Highly recommend for a special night out!","(hamachi curry, excellent); (smoked tuna tartare, tender); (conch croquettes, tender); (broiled shrimp, tender); (goat curry, tender)"
