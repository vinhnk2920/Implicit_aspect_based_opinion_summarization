Their homemade red salsa is a very nice combinations of chilli peppers, it has a smokey flavor and a nice little kick.  I put it on everything.  The green salsa is nice too and has a very bright flavor.\n\nThe dishes with shrimp (burrito and tacos) were super fresh as the shrimp actually tasted like they should with lots of flavor bursting out.  They were not stingy on the portions here and provided plenty of shrimp for the dish!!\n\nChicken tamales also taste as they should and remind me of the tamales I had when I visited Mexico.\n\nThis is a must try if you like Mexican food.  Not a fancy place, but if you enjoy well prepared homemade Mexican food with some regional Puebla dishes, you will be glad you ate here.",

I've had a handful of experiences, and each one has been positive. You can't go wrong with their pizza. But my personal order never changes: chicken bacon ranch grinder with extra ranch on the side, light on the cheese (they sure are generous with it), and a side of curly fries. Bomb af. I've heard praises sung over the buffalo chicken cheesesteak, so if I ever manage to deviate from my standby, that's the way I'll go.\n\nThe friendly, family-oriented vibes are undeniable. I walked in with a noisy toddler but a man, who I believe was the owner, was so chill and laid-back despite her major attitude. He also cut her pizza slice into small pieces. He's *also* let us use their restrooms a couple of times, even when we're neither dining in nor taking out. Shit like this really warms my heart. It's part of what makes a neighborhood pizza joint truly neighborly. The food is great, but the service and spirit take it to another level. I'll continue to visit and order from here when I'm in the area.",

I bought appliances over a year ago and they have held them hostage for months. Told me the appliances were in the warehouse ready to ship. Lost since June at the shipper. Now they want to charge me a $628.00 restocking fee saying I refused delivery. This is just for 1 appliance of the 3 pieces I bought. I was going to purchase another $7000.00 but forget it. After a year trying to get my stuff. I lost money, the rebates. time, and grief.\n\nYes. I have a paper trail showing I waited for the appliances and had a delivery date and alerted the delivery guy and front desk girl, All phone call records to Goedeckers and the trucking company, to the stuff coming. I have more emails not posted telling them I did not want to have to pay fees. I keep all my paper trails. Something told me there was something wrong. The customer service is horrible. Soooo I am calling and emailing my friends,  family and the public not to buy from this company.  Worse experience I have ever had buying appliances ever. Go to your local big box stores you'll be happier.  I am telling you and including a report to BBB do not buy from this store, they do not have it together. I also have a good friend Jon Andre' that just bought $11,000 worth from Goedeker and all of what came was damaged and not all of it came. Moral of this story DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE.......\n\nPS. This August shipment did not come. It was a no show. No one could tell me where it was. Did not know anything about it.  And to date still no Refrigerator or Dishwasher either. Of my $6000.00 I spent this is the way they have treated a customer. Every phone call is we will get back to you within 24 to 48 hours.  Never a call back...",

        "text": "Let me start with the part of our stay that was the absolute BEST part. It wasn't even the room, though it was great. It was Lisa Allison. She works in the breakfast area & she was absolutely amazing! We woke up Sunday Dec 19th & we went down to have breakfast. The breakfast was pretty good for a \"continental breakfast\". We were able to make waffles & most of us loved that. There was a variety of cereal, breads & bagels. I believe there was oatmeal also. (Carbs, carbs, carbs but everything was good. We need energy, right? ) We stopped at numerous Home2 Suites on our trip but I'm pretty sure this location had some breakfast sandwiches or burritos w sausage & egg that we were able to microwave also. That covers breakfast but again the best part of this visit was Lisa! She was a breath of fresh air. She was singing & friendly. She just exuded happiness. She made sure we had everything we needed for breakfast. She checked on  us & everyone else that was getting their breakfast. She made each person in that dining area feel welcome. I don't know what Home2 Suites by Hilton pays her but I can guarantee they aren't paying her enough. She is priceless! She goes above & beyond. We travel a LOT & I have never in my life met someone working in a hotel, especially the breakfast area, who loved their job & showed such kindness to EVERYONE they came in contact with, as Lisa did/does. Wow! I have never wanted to take the time to reach out to a corporate office & compliment someone the way I want to for her. Obviously, she has no idea I'm writing this. I asked for her name right before we left the hotel. I couldn't leave without getting it. \nThe hotel rooms are huge! They are clean. There is enough room for 6 people & that is why I always book Home2 Suites for my family. (If there is one in the city we are staying in ) We are usually only in a hotel long enough to shower, sleep a few hours, grab breakfast & keep driving to our destination but Home2 Suites is ALWAYS our first choice in hotels for our family. We love the long counter that runs down the entire side of the hotel room. It gives us so much room to put our stuff. There's always a fairly large open closet area too, which is really nice. The 2 Queen size beds are very comfortable. Granted, sofa beds are never great anywhere, these are the best of the worst... if you know what I mean. We like the curtain divider in the room. We love the full size refrigerator & having an extra sink outside of the bathroom is very convenient. One night we made Marie Callender's pot pies in the full size microwave bc we didn't want fast food & didn't have time for a sit down restaurant. It worked out great. The dishes & utensils are also convenient. I recommend Home2 Suites to all families that just need a nice, clean hotel for a night. \nAlso, this hotel is in a nice neighborhood. There are restaurants, a movie theater & a Harley Davidson within walking distance! (I stop & buy Harley shirts all over the world for my best friend so this was an added & convenient bonus!) \nThe parking area is well lit & the fire pits/seating area outside looked very inviting. We just didn't have time to sit & relax. \nI definitely recommend staying here!",

        "text": "Out of all the places I dined at in New Orleans, Three Muses left the strongest impression.  This gem of a restaurant has an intoxicating feel that intensifies as you sit and listen to the live jazz music playing in front of you.  The food and drinks will make your night even better.\n\n----The Food----\nTwo Run Farms Lamb Sliders ($9.00)- These super tender lamb sliders come with tomato chutney, herbed garlic goat cheese,and sweet pickles in between soft onion rolls.  It's the best lamb I've had in patty form.  Succulent and robust with flavor.\n\nBeer Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly ($9.00)- Grilled Pork Belly glazed in apple chutney and placed on a bed of rice scallion pancakes.  My pork belly experiences in New Orleans had been bad, but this dish is up to par with my expectations of pork belly.  Although it's fatty, the pork belly is grilled to a crisp so it felt like eating sweet bacon. \n\nThree Muses Fries ($7.00)- Fresh homemade shoe string fries covered in feta cheese and gremolata. Wonderfully done and in great abundance!\n-----\nConclusion: Three Muses is located on Frenchmen Street which is like the Bourbon Street for adults.  It was a welcomed relief from the chaotic nature of New Orleans as this particular small, gastropub had a mature crowd, intimate atmosphere, and great tasting food.  It's just a shame that each table has only a maximum limit of 1.5 hours.  While the menu doesn't have a ton to choose from, they all seem to be creative, fusion, inspired dishes.  Everything from the food and beers (on tap) are reasonably priced too.  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Closed on Tuesdays\n-Love the live jazz music here, it was more of the type of classic jazz that you would unwind to with a bottle of wine.\n-There's an exclusive touch to this place too as the doors are locked from the outside and the only way of entry is by way of the host who is standing outside.  \n-Great customer service as everyone was attentive, patient, and suggestive--very rare in New Orleans\n-Decor consists of dark red wood tables and red artwork on the walls. Lighting is dark.\n-Restrooms could be cleaner",

Super clean, warm, open and inviting space.  \n\nStaff - All staff had great attitudes and positive energy.  Everyone greeted my and or made eye contact and smiled if passing by.  New patient form took 5 minutes max to fill out.\n\nNew Patient Evaluation - I waited 10 minutes to meet the MD for the new patient evaluation conversation.  He was young, smart, engaged, interested and did not rush me through the conversation.  He listened and asked questions actively.  HE took the time to build a relationship and trust.  I felt very comfortable and more important I was HEARD. From here the MD took me straight beck for my xray which he did personally.\n\nServices - I needed an xray for my injury and that went very well.  It took only 5 minutes to take, develop read and discuss with me.\n\nBilling - I have Insurance and as checked out, the front desk informed me that it would be less expensive to just pay for the Xray than to pay my copay..  They saved me $5 by paying attention.  That maters!  \n\nOverall this was a great experience.  This is a great business being run very well and with awesome staff.  I will be taking my wife there now to deal with her Planter Fasciitis which has been plaguing her for years now.",

The Reno Events Center was turned into a huge party Mardi Gras center replete with a variety of bites from sweet to savory. It reminded me of a Dr. Suess quote \"From There To Here From Here To There Fun Things Are Everywhere\". Everywhere you looked there was some tasty bite or well developed wine, brandy or some other libation to be had.\n\nNot to mention the wide array of auction items to bid on. The bidding used new technology and if you were out bid it sent you a message. Super interesting. The items up for auction were numerous such a vacation packages, spa packages, golf packages, fruit baskets, barrel of wine etc. Exciting to watch to see if you won the auction. \n\nMy favorites and places to try around town were Liberty Food and Wine with a salami and cheese toothpick bite, Oxbow Cafe and Bistro with prime rib with a horseradish sauce, Be Sweet 2 Each Other with their lemon cake, Kronenbourg Blanc a light tasting beer from France, Verdi Local Distillery with an Apple Cinnamon Gin (oh my this tasted like apple pie) this was super yummy. \n\nI have a new list of different businesses to try out.

Fresh frozen pasta, chicken parm, chicken lasagna in a cream sauce, tiramisu....just to name a few.  They even have Indian Vindaloo, Moussaka, Hungarian, German, French, Thai...that is pretty eclectic.  The chicken meatballs were pretty tasty.\n\nThe cheese arancini is great!  The cannolois are good.  I really want to pick up their fresh burratta.  They also have kinder surprise eggs-which are banned in the United States.\n\nIf you dine in, they will call out your order...there are plenty of places to sit, serve yourself pitchers of water, if you do not purchase a beverage from the cooler.\n\nOh, the Brie salad also sounds great!!!!

The hostess was quick to seat us, and the servers were consistent in getting orders, topping off waters, delivering food, and generally checking in. \n\nThe prices were comparable to other downtown SB places - high - but not astronomical. The great thing was that the food was actually *good*. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and my husband ordered the Truffle Mushroom Burger. Both were cooked well while remaining moist. Each had a toasted bun, fresh-tasting toppings, and complimentary sauces. But the fries - those were the show-stopper of the meal. They were fluffy, crispy on the outside (like they were double-fried?) and not too thick or too thin. Plus, our meals came with them (no up-charge) and they were abundant!\n\nThe beer, even off of happy hour, was a much better price than a lot of other eateries.

We shared the same interests (international culture, vegetarianism, love of nightlife).  A special night like New Years Eve is a risky proposition for a blind date--so much pressure to be special for the big occasion.  But....I was feeling lucky, so I took the plunge and reserved a 7:30 table for dinner with Laxmi.  As the night approached, I admit that I got ahead of myself with her.

        "text": "I'm going to come right out and say it. I love the Brass Tap. If it weren't for my wonderful back porch, it would be my favorite place to hang out and have a beer. Well, on second thought, my back porch doesn't have hundreds of different beers to choose from. So yeah, the Brass Tap IS my favorite place to have a beer. \n\nMy first experience at the Tap occurred almost a year ago. The wife and I were at Wiregrass mall doing some shopping and were really hungry. We saw this new place and thought we'd try it. As I looked through what I thought was a food menu, I realized that there was only beer and wine available. We left in search of food. Flash forward to March of this year. Wife takes me to the mall during March Madness. She can tell that I don't want to go stand around in Express while she tries on half the store, so she tells me to wait at the Brass Tap and watch some basketball. About an hour (and four beers) later, she finds her slightly drunk husband perched outside on the patio about to order another one. \n\nSince that wonderful visit, the wife and I have spent many a day and night sitting out on the patio, people watching and drinking great beer from all around the world. Best of all, we've made friends along the way. See, The Brass Tap to me is kind of like my back porch away from home. I feel comfortable. I feel happy. And what makes a better drinking environment than that?\n\nThe Tap has plenty of entertainment to keep you occupied too. You can play darts in the back, watch one of about 20 televisions, or experience some great live music. Every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night, The Brass Tap features great local bands and singers. I really enjoy live music, especially good live music, and I've never been disappointed there. Perhaps my favorite night though is Tuesday. Starting around 9:30, The Tap offers karaoke until the wee hours of the morning. Let's face it, drunk people singing is usually great, even when it's terrible. I've been known to get up and sing a few tunes myself. I fall into the terrible category, but at least I realize it. \n\nOh yes...The beer! With over 40 beers on tap, a list that changes quite frequently, and hundreds of other beers in bottles, you can go there and never have to drink the same beer twice. Sometimes I find it fun to go on a tour of a particular county while there. Although I usually end up just living in Belgium. For non-beer drinkers they also have a nice selection of wines, and if you are the type to bring your kids to a bar, they'll even rustle up some sodas. You can even purchase cigars there as well to accompany your drinks. \n\nI mentioned before that on my first trip there, I was disappointed to not find any food on the menu. Fortunately, the two restaurants that bookend The Brass Tap offer to go service, usually going as far as having waiters come over to take orders and deliver. This comes in handy for someone like myself, who seems to really like the 8% alcohol and above beers. \n\nWhat really sets The Brass Tap apart is the staff. We have been fortunate enough to get to know many of the girls that serve there and every one of them is always knowledgeable, friendly, and pretty easy on the eyes too. Even when the waitresses we love move on to new things, the management seems pretty capable of finding the right kind of people to work there. \n\nSo, in case you couldn't already tell, The Brass Tap is my favorite bar. If I could, I'd go every day. This blog would get pretty boring though if I never went anywhere else. Still, this is always a must at least once or twice a week. Sometimes more. In fact, just writing about it has perked up my taste buds for a nice, cold Chimay. Before I hop in the car, I'll leave you with this. Remember the show Cheers? Sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name. And if you're like me, then that's usually a bar. The Brass Tap is my \"Cheers\" bar. Come in sometime. I'll be sure to scream \"Norm!\" at you.",

        "text": "We had our original testing done in Memphis, TN with a doctor there, he \"diagnosed\" me/us with \"unexplained infertility\". We moved across country and were excited to see that there was a facility close to us in Reno that had decent success rates and reviews. Unfortunately, Dr. Whitten did not order any additional testing or dig further into our case. I was disappointed by that and really wanted a laparoscopy referral because I suspect I may have endometriosis. His response was that it wouldn't change the way he treated me/us. I accepted his decision and moved forward with 4 IUI's. Dr. Whitten performed my first IUI, where I had two follicles and responded well to the meds. I didn't see him at all in the following 3 IUI's. I also only produced one follicle in the last 3 cycles. After the 4 IUI's failed we had an IVF consultation with Dr. Whitten. We looked over my 4 IUI cycles and he said he would have liked for me to have produced 2 follicles per cycle. This should have been a red flag to me that he wasn't as detail oriented as I would like for him to be. Why didn't he catch that as it was happening? But, whatever, we decided to move forward with IVF. \n\nThe beginning of my IVF cycle went relatively smoothly. The meds were easy to order and communication was pretty good. \n\nIt all went downhill after that. We used a trigger shot exactly 36 hours before the scheduled egg retrieval. Around 12 hours after I gave myself the two shots I drove to Reno for bloodwork so that they could check my LH levels. Apparently they were below normal (we learned this when we sat down with Dr. Whitten after this cycle ended). Why was that not caught before my egg retrieval? I had a pregnyl shot ready to go. It feels negligent. \n\nMy egg retrieval went smoothly and I had no complications. The communication in the following days was hellish. We have never been through anything like this before and expected good communication when it came to what we considered to be our future babies. We always had to reach out first, including the day after my egg retrieval when someone was supposed to check on me. \n\nBetween day 4-5 nine out of ten of our embryos arrested. We had one left. At the end of day 6 we were told we would receive a phone call letting us know if our last remaining embryo continued growing. We waited all day for the phone call. Finally, at 3:45pm I received a phone call from the nurse letting me know she was \"sorry, but the embryologists are too busy to check on your embryo\". It was devastating. We had to go another day before we finally got the call that it made it. \n\nWe felt that the way they operate their IVF cycle is irresponsible and they're clearly seeing too many women. The nurse informed me there were atleast 60 girls. Also, Dr. Whitten only does IVF cycles every other month because its \"more convenient for him and his staff\". All of these things added up to a traumatic and heartbreaking experience. The cherry on top was when they charged us the same amount to store one embryo as they would charge for ten embryos. They refused to refund us because \"it's how their pricing works\". We paid cash because they refuse to take BCBS. \n\nI'm not blaming Dr. Whitten for any issues that exist within my body or my husbands but he did not handle our case with care. We have since started seeing a new doctor who has ordered extensive testing on both of us, including referring me to surgeon to check for endometriosis. \n\nOur one embryo came back abnormal. Only after all of this, a failed IVF cycle, did Dr. Whitten suggest a genetic karyotype test. Our new doctor ordered it for us weeks ago (before we even had the embryo results). I will update this review as I move forward with the new clinic but wanted to warn anyone looking for a doctor who digs deep/ diagnose.",

I also occasionally pop in for a quick bite and order pork buns.\n\nIf you're leaving campus and exiting through Pardall Tunnel, Lao Wang is the first restaurant on your right. This specific location has had multiple tenants over the years, replacing Otaco in 2017 (which replaced Angry Wings, which replaced Chino's Rock & Tacos). But it looks like the curse may have been lifted, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for them. There are small tables outside, with larger group tables inside. You walk up to the counter to place your order, and they'll call it out when it's ready.\n\nEZ as 123:\n\n1. Select your soup base - Original, Spicy, Vegan, or simply Dry.\n2. Select your noodles - Egg Noodle is the thinner version, almost like ramen. Rice noodles are a bit thicker.\n3. Select your toppings - anything from vegetables, extra meat, to anything you'll find in hot pot meals. I tend to get beef, bokchoy, tofu, or imitation crab meat.\n\nThe weakest link is their broth, it's very one-dimensional and lacking in flavor, which is unlike real hot pot. I feel like it's also on the saltier side, like someone dumped one of those packets you use for instant ramen. On the other hand, the noodles are well cooked and maintain good shape. I would get takeout even before COVID, and it won't be a soggy mess after a couple minutes. The toppings I get taste good, no complaints there.\n\nTheir Popcorn Chicken is good by itself, I'm not fond of their popcorn chicken bun. Stewed Pork Belly Bao is well-proportioned, with the right amount of bun, vegetables, and pork with every bite.\n\nHaven't tried their rice bowls yet, that's for my next visit!",

I saw the wonton soup pic that was posted on this yelp page and thought it would be an authentic, thin skinned wonton, but it turns out that it was super thick skin, very little filling wonton.  The wonton soup had no taste.  I was very disappointed.  The chicken and mushroom also had no taste. It only had a cornstarch sauce and they didn't even use chinese mushroom for the dish. Also a disappointment.  I don't even know how to describe the double cooked pork. It was thinly sliced pork with a tasteless sauce and stir fried with  A LOT of cabbage.  The cabbage was used to make the dish look full.  The deep fried tofu was the only one that had some taste to it, but it definitely not authentic.    I will not be returning to this place.",

Don't listen to the person who said the atmosphere reminded him of PF Changs. It feels like a hip restaurant on the inside. The pear sake might be my favorite drink I've ever had. I can't say enough positive things about this place. \n\nThere was a large family style Filipino feast going on while we were there last time and while I wouldn't ever participate as a vegetarian it looked like such a cool thing to do. The restaurant owner was there and took the time to explain the food to the guests. It truly looked like a great time if meat is your thing. \n\nI can't wait to go back another time for that pear sake alone. I wish they were open during the week for lunch.

Shrimp taco came in second with a delish fruit salsa and crema. Third place went to the zucchini and cheese pupusa-lovely grilled veg taste and large portion.

        "text": "I had the UNfortunate experience of visiting this store, just yesterday.  There really should be signage somewhere on or around this store, visible from the outside to warn potential customers: \"Enter at your own risk!\" or something along those lines to convey a message to the public that if you do decide to enter this store please be aware of the cold reception of the employee(s) you are about to encounter & do not, under any circumstances, use terms of endearment whilst inside! Maybe something like: \"Hear ye! Hear ye! AT&T Disclaimer to customers of the Bensalem store:  Any forms of excitement, gratitude, 'upbeatness' and/or friendliness will not be tolerated at this location especially when Babe Wonder (Jeff) is working and please keep all and any forms of verbal pleasantries at the door.  You now have been warned of the zero tolerance policy of the aforementioned offensible behaviors including any positive verbal sentiments and if exhibited whilst in the store be prepared to elicit this response from staff/Jeff/babe: (including but not limited to) rude behavior, no introductions, ZERO (that's 'nil' for my European friends out there) customer service skills, dirty looks, ignoring the obvious, ignoring paper work that customer provides that matches paper work in AT&T employee's (tiny) hands, shady conduct and altogether bad, bad, bad business.\"  So before entering the store remember the golden rule when in the presence of AT&T's finest Bensalem in-store phone technician, numero uno, customer service extraordinaire aka Babe Wonder/Babe in...Electronic Handheld Device...Toyland/Jeff-babe or plain JB: Do not! I repeat...Do not refer to this man as babe! Never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever use the word 'babe' towards, in reference to and around this man.  Even when using the word 'babe' in the context to describe him as: 1.) An inexperienced person with many infantile manners, characteristics & body parts... or to use the word as 2.) An accolade to pay homage to him, as the obvious muse & main source of inspiration for the protagonist in the critically acclaimed children's cinema classic- \"BABE\" (who can forget that lil' pig)... and NOT that of 3.) A friendly/endearing term of address.  Aww, Jeff... you thought I was coming at you with #3... You poor thing!  If you only knew at the time of our awkward exchange that when I referred to you as 'babe' it was in the context of numbers 1 & 2 (see definition's above). You silly man! Such confusion... Anyway... as I was.. Remember.. no usage of the word babe is allowed when in the company of JB! To be clear, in case there is any confusion, I will now clarify for all: Jeff is not my babe.  I overstepped my boundary by calling him so the other day while at the store.  As his soulless eyes gazed into me as he barked, \"I'm not your babe.\" It was then in that moment that I knew whose babe he actually was... I was in the presence of the one... the only... (drum-roll...) babe of Rosemary!!! aka the spawn of Satan!! I was completely star struck!  Rosemary's baby right here in front of me.  Well I'll be damned... So at this time I would like to shout out Jeff aka Rosemary's babe, not mine! Thanks for the interesting exchange, \"exceptional service\" and one of the better laughs I have had in awhile, BABE! Nobody puts babe in a corner...by calling him... babe!  If only you really were my babe (sigh)... A girl can dream... See you in my dreams babe!  \nAnother disclaimer: The AT&T Bensalem store @ 2737 Street Rd has unofficially been renamed to Douchebags R Us with the slogan, \"A place to find toads with one thing on their minds: social awkwardness.

The check-in or front desk has full plexiglass separation and masks are required everywhere inside the common areas (3/7/21) The lobby is very clean and comfortable and there's a lovely spacious and comfortable courtyard just off the lobby as well. This is rated as a 3 star hotel so If you are looking for luxury, this isn't a luxury hotel however it is very clean and very comfortable and a it's great value. Big comfy bed, big shower, coffee maker, iron and ironing board, big LG TV (42 channels with HBO, fridge and microwave in room and coffee service in the morning with a simple breakfast, all good.\n\nThe Hilton app works just fine for most things, lacks some helps and the GUI is a little clumsy. I used it successfully but I write software so the fact that it was a little annoying to me could spell trouble for less techie folks. The keyless or digital key system is functional but takes some poking around to get it working. The parking costs $17 for everyone and can also be done through the app as well.  The Hilton Honors hotline is a very, very long wait but the people here at this Hampton Inn have been very responsive and helpful via phone. \n\nI did both digital and regular check-in so both work just fine. When you desk check-in you leave a credit card for incidentals ($25) then your parking, etc. is taken from that. They gave you a parking tag to put in your window. The parking is easily accessible off the back entrance in a gated lot, easy in & out. Your room key is needed to enter the building after hours and for the elevators at all times to go upstairs. \n\nLocation is a big deal and this one, on St. Charles, is not far from the I-10 and actually very convenient to downtown and the French Quarter via the nearby trolley that will take you into and out of most anywhere you want to go. This place is actually on the Mardis Gras parade route and only a couple blocks from the popular Magazine Street venues. The biggie for me is being far enough away from the heavy traffic but still close enough for a lot of the stuff I want to do in NOLA. \n\nOther immensities are a couple computers with desks and printers and printer, an outdoor pool and meeting rooms. Pets are not allowed. \n\nBottom line: Clean room, comfy bed, good WiFi, great thermostat temp control, extra cushy pillows and everything I need to chill with my honey and for a good night's sleep.

Our server was warm and friendly, & since we had never been here before and were feeling whimsical, we described some of the wines we liked, then had her select something she thought we would enjoy. She took obvious joy in this task & it was much more fun than just ordering off the menu! We suggested a price point of around $10 and were surprised when we finally looked at a menu and realized that it was the top of their \"by the glass\" price range. We usually hang out in South Tampa, where $10 is often the cheapest option. It was refreshing to see an affordable and accessible list. I was not familiar with many of the wines listed, which was another plus. Our server said they try to sell wines that are not widely distributed. We both enjoyed our wine, and she opened a more expensive bottle for my husband and served it to him at the $10 price point because she was excited for him to try it. That illustrates the great service we had.\n\nIn short: affordable, great customer service, delicious wine, fun people watching, and lack of pretension!

Is it trying to be a skater place, a bar, a music place, a hip lounge, a hipster hangout (or whatever hipsters want to call the places they frequent), or an eatery.  \n\nThe only answer I came up with is a combination of all of the above (except for hipsters, didn't see many) which works beautifully.  It's like that one dish you try at a pot luck.  You look at the ingredients, they don't seem like they're going to jive, but in the end they just do.  \n\nIn terms of consumables, they have a great drink list and some specialty in house mix drinks which seem pretty awesome.  Being a beer and shots kinda guy, I got to working my way down their chalkboard list of beer and trying some locals I've never had before.  Then I just (at the risk of looking hispterish since apparently they've invaded Milwaukee) went to drinking a PBR pounder.  The nachos were amazing and had good flavor.  They also didn't skimp on the cheese or topping like some other places.  There's nothing sadder than shelling out some hard-earned coin to end up with dry corn chips after only one layer.  Dinner was the Bird and Pig and the Burrito.  (Note:  yes, i'm a big boy, now I didn't have 2 dinners.  That's what we ordered and I had some of both).  \n\nThe ambiance was good.  They had some good music playing, some old skool thrown in there and a nice anime playing on the TV. I asked the bartender for the title and promptly added it to my Netflix queue (yea, I had a bit of a nerdgasm).  All the bartenders were friendly and inviting, and the blonde girl with pigtails is not only strikingly beautiful, but she has some great ink.  \n\nAll in all, I will definitely be back to this place when I'm back in Ybor, even if it is a few blocks from the main drag.",

Having said that, I am not a huge fan of the menu style but understand where they are coming from in terms of being conscientious with their food and making a profit. Which seems tough considering how much my group puts away. The biggest downfall is that they no longer serve the green tea and red bean ice cream which truly were the one item I could always make room for. These options are only available at dinner. I am not asking for special treatment, but when my group comes in and fills a whole hibachi table on a Wednesday I feel an exception could be made for seasoned visitors.

I envisioned all of it, plus some awesome go-go/60s/retro music to go along with it. \n\nI was a bit taken aback when I walked in on Saturday night and N'Sync was blaring... ok, maybe it was early so they music would change over the night? But it didn't. Love Shack, I Touch Myself, MJ, Madonna.... some of the songs were good, some were a bit too cheesy for my liking. It didn't jive with the vibe of the bar. I went in the mood to dance, but needless to say I didn't end up dancing. It felt sort of like a 90s junior high dance, complete with the group of girls (women) dancing in a circle. \n\nOnto the positives, which are pretty much everything else. Like I said, I loved the way the decorated the place. The art was cool. There is so much detail put into everything. The record player menus are cool, and I appreciated the little logos for each individual cocktail. I also liked the coasters that doubles as shot menus, and the fact that the shots were named after all of the zodiac signs. My favourite, favourite, favourite was the bathroom covered in astro turf with over sized foliage and dragonfly on the ceiling. I don't know where I felt like I was, but certainly not Edmonton. \n\nOur waitress was funny and cute and a little bit awkward but in a cool way. She was one of the best servers I've had, honestly.

Best I've ever had and I love Spanish rice. It was moist enough, had flavor and I love how there were small pieces of onion still. The chicken enchilada was a good size. I couldn't finish the whole enchilada. It was moist and flavorful. The red sauce was so good on top. You have a choice of cheese, I wasn't sure so the cashier picked the cheese for me after asking me what meat I wanted. \n\nChips and salsa were provided free. The pico de gallo was the best I have ever tasted. It had some flavor to it and the jalapeños was actually spicy, which I love!!! There's so many different sauces provided at the bar. A bowl of chips will be placed on your table by someone. \n\nPrice: For three plates and two sodas, we paid $47. It's a little pricey, but the food is so good and the amount you get is a lot. \n\nService: It can get quite busy and full, but a table will get cleared fast. There's menus provided near the exit, which is nice since you can decide on what you want to order. There's two cashiers that will help take your orders and they're really helpful and fast. Grab a number and place it on your table, and someone will find your table. There's a couple of employees who will go around asking if each table is doing okay.\n\nParking: There's very limited parking in the back of the restaurant and it's small spaces. Although there's street parking too.\n\nDefinitely try this place out!",

Zoes is no exception.  \n\nMy shrimp kabobs were PHENOMENAL.  I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting based on others reviews, but wow.  They were PERFECTLY cooked, and they were FRESH.  If these suckers had ever been frozen I would be shocked.  They were so good I was turning my head so no one would see me suck the shells.  (Don't judge me, I lived in New Orleans.)  The grilled zucchini was nice and charred and SPICY!, which I was not expecting, but I don't mind a lil kick being from the south so I enjoyed that.  But if you don't like spicy food... watch out for that!  I was NOT expecting it at all!  lol  The cucumber sauce was divine.  It complimented the shrimp beautifully and really just accented the whole dish.  (And really helped to cool down those zucchini!)  The side greek salad was perfect.  Loved the extra bottles of dressing, but ESPECIALLY loved the pepper grinders on the tables.  Wish all restaurants did this.  I love fresh cracked pepper on everything.  lol  (But honestly, nothing needed to be seasoned and didn't need any extra dressing.)  \n\nThe pesto hummus was incredible.  My husband will not TOUCH hummus.  Baby vomit he says.  I've NEVER seen him eat it since I've known him.  But he loves Pesto.  TA-DA!  CONVERT!  *yay*  Now I can finally get him to try other types of hummus and I can FINALLY order hummus again.  Oh how I have missed hummus.  The pita was so soft and warm like little pillows to scoop up copious amounts of hummus.  I just wish they had given more pita.  I was happy to get extra pita with the entree.  I used that to eat the leftover hummus.  Not a chance in the world that was getting left behind.  \n\nI'm sure my husbands meal was good too.  It was the Mediterranean chicken.  He said it was good, and he ate every last bite of it.  I did try the white beans which were VERY tasty.  I love white beans.  I love pretty much all beans.  (again, its a southern thing.  lol)  But I was so involved in my shrimp kabobs that aliens could have invaded outside and I would have never even noticed.  \n\nWe will be back.  A lot.

But whenever I get to an ice cream shop, I never managed to get what I want. So last night after dinner and walking around town with the boyfriend, we, intentionally, ended up in this part of the town aiming for Franklin Fountain. \n\nI've never been here before and didn't know what to expect but I've heard great things about it. Upon arriving and see the little line out side the small shop, I know that I've come to the right place. There are about 15 table lining up outside the small corner stores with trash \"barrels\" and metal tubs for dirty dishes. Inside, it is decided colonial with servers dressing up down to the fan drapes made out of flags that lines the walls. An old-timey cashier that made clinky sound. I do enjoy these things. \n\nI originally just want a sundae, but the boyfriend wanted an ice cream soda... so I got them both! I ordered a coke soda with coconut ice cream and a Southern Sympathizer with hydro cookies and peanut butter ice cream. I have to say I've never got into ice cream sodas, I think it's a waste of ice cream and a waste on soda. I like ice cream too much to see it melt away in soda and I've never been a big fan of creamy sodas but at the end it wasn't so bad. Don't try to put your spoon in the soda when it first come out. I did and it overflowed and splashed all over.  The Southern Sympathizer was sprinkled with pecan and brittles with caramel sauce and whipped cream. The ice cream was really good but it turned out a bit sweet. With no glass of water for relief and a faucet to wash my hands, it is a bit inconvenient but how can you not have fun with ice cream?\n\nNext time I'll have a bottle of water ready. \n\nP.S. This is a cash only place, the things here are about $10 a piece and I nearly not have enough cash, so make sure before coming.",

The Descendent Dubbel is also very good, and both of them are better than anything Taxman makes. If you're into other styles, both the Holy Rolled Oat IPA and the Popemeal Oat Stout are excellent as well. I pray these all become permanent brews here.\n\nFOOD: The food was surprisingly awesome. We split the hefty, delicious Bison Meatloaf Sandwich (with extra gravy, by request, at no extra cost). The \"fries\" should be described as seasoned, curvy potato rounds; they resemble waffle fries without the holes. While few in number, they hit the spot.\n\nEXTRA INFO: There's a narrow, single-row parking lot along the south edge of the building. Various growler deals on different days are worth checking out, too. Biggest downside: the number of TVs in this place is too damn high!\n\nVERDICT: The reviews are misleading; this place is a solid choice!

        "text": "For whatever reason, this is the first time we have actually tried this establishment. I'm a born and raised NYC Brat, so I like to think I'm a bit of a pizza aficionado.  Ego (or lack thereof) aside, I'm used to the best.  I'm not sure whether I'm yet satisfied up to now with the pizza scene here in God's Waiting Room. \n\nOne good sign was that the girl who answered the phone was busy as all get out. She had to keep putting me on hold while she had another four calls waiting. I even heard her ask for help from somebody! Oh, dear! She was quite polite and apologetic as well. Made good use of her time and was as efficient as I could expect.\n\nAnyhow: I ordered stuffed mushrooms and a Bro's Special. That particular pie has sausage, pepperoni, onion, peppers and (here we go again) mushrooms. I was told 45-60 min. Door bell rang after not even 35! Wow; driver must be NASCAR material! Friendly young man, too.\n\nOn to the shrooms, first. Stuffed with provolone, onion, sausage and swimming in a slap yo' mama good white wine sauce. Those shrooms definitely were real, unprocessed white mushrooms. These bad boys were a symphony of flavor. The Queen Bee even said that they were the best stuffed mushrooms she's ever had. I was a bit taken aback that for $6.50 the container only had 4 caps. But they really WERE AWESOME. \n\nPizza, as described above, definitely reminded me of typical NYC/NJ pizza. It ain't Spumoni Gardens good or John's good, but regular NYC good. I usually look for a few things to determine its NYness. First, the thing was nearly as wide as a manhole cover; crust thin. Chewy, light dough with a great bite and a slightly sweet finish.\n\nCheese was just enough to keep all the rest of the toppings from falling off; same with the sauce. Just enough to keep it from being too dry. Toppings were all quite good as well as plentiful. Decent quality pepperoni, sausage crumbles; fresh veggies! Adds up to an A. Yay!!!!\n\nFoldability test is a definite B+, and the dough itself merits an A. The front end of the slice dropped just a wee bit, but with all that yum on top...that's what the other hand is for. I taught the Queen Bee how to eat a slice like a true New Yorker, and now she follows suit. \n\nDrip test was also a B+; just a wee little grease from the roni and sausage. I saw a wee little grease hit the plate; no drip down the arm or puddles on plate. All the toppings stayed put  with the occasional piece of onion or pepper fall off. That means just the right amount of sauce and not a huge load of \"mutz.\"\n\nQueen Bee and I both think that we found our new favorite pizza down here. I look forward to trying some of their other goodies, too. We will definitely order from this place again. It was a real decent taste of NY. If I could give half stars this joint would get 4.5 on the Will-O-Meter. \"Yo...They got a great pie ovah here!!!\" Oh, dear!",

No ball was left behind!\n\n\nI also ordered the Bleu Gruyere burger; two hand packed patties, Bleu Cheese, Gruyere, onion jam, mixed greens, dijonaise...hold the bun. For some reason I thought the burgers were much bigger. Don't be intimidated by the double patties; they're only 2oz each.

We were sat immediately but about half the restaurant was empty.  We ordered a bottle of wine and put our food order in immediately, lets say 7:35.  Things were fine up until this point.  My wife and I ordered the chicken, my mom ordered the pork and I can't remember what my dad ordered.  So at 8:05 my dad asked our waitress about the our order and she said she would check.  She came back out and said there was a wedding upstairs and that is why it had taken so long, but would be out shortly.  Another half hour goes by, my mom asks again as we finish bottle of wine number 2, waitress says the chicken is taking a while and the wedding set them back a bit but the food will be up shortly.  Fine, no big deal, we don't have anywhere to be.  Another half hour goes by and every table that was seated after us has either gotten their food or is already gone.  My dad asks to speak to the manager at this point, he comes over and says \"did no one tell you about the wedding upstairs?\"  WHAT???? What does that have to do with us waiting an hour and a half for food.  When we point out that every other person in the half empty restaurant had gotten their food he explained that \"oh but you ordered the chicken\".  WHAT????  What kind of chicken were we getting that it takes an hour and a half?  We ask to cancel our order and for our bill and he ignores us and says our food will be right out.  Then the owner comes over (not Jim Edmonds) and he keeps with the company line that we should have been told about the wedding and that the reason the restaurant was half empty was because they stopped taking reservations because of the wedding.  He made it seem like it was our fault for going there when there was a wedding (obviously we had no way of knowing about it).  When I said that they should honor the reservations that they did make or have called and cancelled it, he moved off the wedding and on to the chicken.....  THE CHICKEN AGAIN!??!!   I asked him if he was really telling us that it takes an hour and a half to make chicken and an extra 45 minutes more than any other dish?  Long story shorter, he was a total arrogant a$$, so was the manager, acted like it was our fault for ordering the chicken and coming when there was a wedding.  Our waitress then came out crying, so they wouldn't apologize to us but they obviously ripped her a new one in the back.  We finally got our food, it was sh*t...  chicken was obviously way over cooked or had been sitting under the heating lamp for quite some time.  We asked for our bill, they took nothing off and over charged us for some items that we had asked for that we had never gotten.  They offered a free desert when they brought back the corrected bill but a simple apology and admitting they had made a mistake would have gone a lot farther.  We declined the desert and that is the last time I will ever go there.",

This being our first time to Uccellino and her first time to any Daniel Costa restaurant we came with a healthy appetite and open mind. \n\nEVERYTHING tasted good. Balanced flavours, perfect level of seasoning, classic pairing, and interesting combinations I didn't expect. \n\nThe Beef Carpaccio is a MUST order. The level of lemon acid balanced out the tender and rich Beef Tenderloin while the celery root gave it crunch and complexity. Add the parmasan and you have the added bite and nutty flavour to round out the dish. \n\nThe Gnocchi was the softest I've ever had. Because they used ricotta as the filling there was literally no chance that it would get chewy. This was a brilliant move and ensures that there is no equal to this dish in the whole city! Of course the rich bolognese added the umami and brought the clouds of gnocchi down to earth in a grounding and familiar manner.\n\nThe lamb leg is traditionally a tougher cut that needs to be braised, roasted, or sous vide. I believe they went with the third option but they finished it on the grill to give it some charring. The centre was perfectly medium and there wasn't a tough piece throughout. I could have just ordered this for myself because I enjoy lamb so much. \n\nI got the reservation about 10 days in advance. I had initially tried to reserve their sister restaurant Corso32 but they were doing renovations and I couldn't get a seat before 9:30pm.

It's the same you buy at any grocery store and it's not warmed but cold. It's served with hummus which is very very heavy on the cumin. You also get spanikopita which has probably been rewarmed in a microwave. The pastry on top was soggy and chewy and the filling was blistering hot. Two dolmades were served and they were simply okay. We also were served a bowl of tzatziki which was severely heavy on the dill. All of it tasted fair to bad and nothing was memorable. \n\nAvgolemeno Soup: this is what the restaurant prides itself on and it was good - not great and not \"I'd drive 4 hours one way to get it\" but good. I really liked that there was actual lemon flavor in the soup. I had to pick out 4 bay leaves and while I understand the soup is homemade I feel this was a sloppy presentation \n\nChicken kabobs: no salt whatsoever. Chunks of chicken were seasoned in mostly oregano and cooked well. After salting the chicken my wife just gave up on trying to season the dish as the rice too was flavorless and bland (think Uncle Ben's Instant). \n\nPastitsio: this dish was just plain bad. The worst offender was the bechamel sauce. It was thick and flavorless with much too much nutmeg (a little in a bechamel is good but this tasted like Christmas smells). It seemed to be heated to within an inch of its culinary life which makes me wonder if the kitchen is using a microwave and if so how long is the food sitting around in pans in the back? This dish also lacked salt and the ground meat was extremely greasy. \n\nThis is the same restaurant that was in Ellisville and had a five star rating peppered with a few three and two star reviews like mine. \n\nMy wife and I went on a Thursday evening because we had a good experience in Ellisville. We walked in and the decor is MUCH better than their previous location. We were promptly seated and given menus. \n\nThe menu is heavy on appetizers and short plates and skimps a bit on entrees - especially considering that some entrees are not available each day.\n\nI was in the mood for any cocktail of any sort but their only alcoholic offerings were wine and beer. I ordered an iced tea instead and when I got it the glass was filled with murky tea and had coffee grounds floating about. Needless to say I switched to water. \n\nI had tried to order the moussaka but they only have it twice a week which was disappointing. \n\nIn all, I'll give the Greek Kitchen the benefit of the doubt and hope they up their game but with so many other Greek offerings in the metro area their game comparatively is off for the time being.",

The sauce was so delicious that we had to ask for spoons to lap it up. Our other friend ordered the shrimp with blood orange sauce and dubbed it \"the best shrimp dish I've ever eaten.\"\n\nPasta\n\nThe special pasta of the evening was a rabbit ravioli in sage brown butter sauce with toasted pistachios. The handmade pasta was cooked perfectly and melted on the tongue to reveal an amazing seasoned, and flavorful rabbit meat inside. Think of the flavor of Italian sausage but more tender and less heavy. We also tried the truffled potato ravioli, which was equally as delicious if not better. Each bite revealed an even balance of melted butter and potent truffle flavor.\n\nSecondo\n\nAlready loving my meal and feeling somewhat adventurous I ordered the special entree of the evening which was a veal cheek over grilled eggplant with Gorgonzola cheese in a sweet and sour sauce. It was my first time indulging in veal cheeks and I was blown away by the flavor, tenderness and complexity of the meat. I would have preferred something different than the sweet and sour sauce on the dish, but when all components were eaten together, I experienced the elusive foodgasm in my mouth. The others ordered the duck leg confit which was superbly cooked and seasoned and the monk fish with shrimp and clams, which had a delicious sauce but was served on a large piece of toast that seemed like unnecessary filler.\n\nDolce\n\nBy the end of the meal, we were all full enough that dessert was questionable, but since it was included in the prix fixe we couldn't turn it down. We all ordered differently - a tiramisu which was one of the better I've had, a blueberry-coconut torte which was surprisingly delicious despite low expectations, with large blueberries and a pumpkin cake with Nutella which turned out to be a perfectly baked pumpkin loaf with.... a dollop of Nutella.\n\nOur server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the evening, always checking in on us and even brought shots of sambuca after overhearing that we were there to celebrate my friend's birthday. The brilliance of Modo Mio lies in the extremely reasonable prix fixe and how perfectly portioned each course is. You will leave the restaurant extremely satisfied but not stuffed to the gills. Add the fact that its BYOB and in an area where there is an abundance of parking and you have pure gold. Just make sure to remember that it is cash only and to make a reservation in advance! Will most definitely be back to taste even more of the menu.",

He was unable to help with my issue, but he still gave advice and offered to give me a referral to an oral surgeon if my problem did not resolve on its own.\n\nCons:\n- Paperless*: They use an online portal system and you fill out all paperwork on an iPad. I wish I had been sent the link to this paperwork beforehand however, because by the time I finished, I was almost 30 min past my appointment time.\n- I had a question about one of the agreements I was asked to sign, and was told they would have to get a manager. A manager was never called and my question was never addressed.\n- Not quite sure why it was necessary, but the first thing they did when I was called was take my picture. If you are at an emergency dentist at 8am on a weekend, chances are you are not really in the mood to have your picture taken. I found this to be a bit odd, and I wasn't given the option to decline.\n- The waiting room has clearly been updated but the back and exam rooms need some work- and are not as clean as I would prefer for a dentist's office.\n- Before meeting the doctor, I was seen by an \"assistant\"? I don't even know because he didn't clearly introduce himself. He was not particularly friendly, and I also found some of his comments to be unprofessional. For example, he made an odd comment as if to minimize or downplay what I was there for, and when my exam was over he also said, \"see, you'll live\". I know the dentist is the last place I certainly wanted to be on a weekend, but I still expected the same level of professionalism and I did not get that here (at least not from the assistant).\n\nBecause I only ended up receiving a consultation (no actual procedures) I did not have to pay, which I appreciated. I would return, but probably only for an emergency when I can't reach my normal dentist.",

Go on a date, or take your kids and run around, or go by yourself and read a book in the quietness of a great piece of art.  Indy...just go!  And visitors, go to the museum and when you crave some outdoors, pop behind the museum to enjoy the 100 Acres park. \n\nI took my three young nieces (aged 6, 9 and 11) and in addition to running around and exploring the large art installations from the grass maze to the swings made from a tree, finding all 15 \"yellow benches\" (part of the art in the park and although it says there are 13, I think there are actually 15) was an activity that ultimately led us on a exploration around the entire park and lake.  They loved looking for these kooky and cool designed bright yellow benches (more to look at as art, then actually sit on for the most part) and then running all over them when we finally came upon them.  It was kind of a scavenger hunt that moved us around the park.  \n\nWe had packed a picnic as well and enjoyed our lunch under a shady spot.  Be sure to bring water in the summer at the very least, for there is no place to purchase water or food on sight.  \n\nThere is signage on the backside of the lake path indicating that it is closed due to erosion.  We were careful and stayed single file on the path and were fine.  Just be mindful and be careful and if you are not a secure walking/hiker, don't take this path.  Even without going on this path, there is such great outdoor spaces to see and enjoy. \n\nThere are art museum attendants parked in lawn chairs in a couple spots if any questions were to arise, there are maps of the park at the entrances (also the attendants would have them I would think) and there are also port-a-potties and restrooms available.  \n\nWhat a neat space located in Indy.

So I have been coming to this Quest for over 3.5 years.  To me, this is the cleanest lab in town, or the cleanest lab I have experienced at least in the Reno/Sparks area. Parking can be a bit of a pain though because its just tight and sometimes busy parking lot. \n\nThe \"main\" lab lady, Michelle, is super skilled, and knowledgeable. In my experience, she has always been great to work with. Once when my labs were expired, another tech refused to draw so I left until my doctors could get a new order faxed in, but Michelle called me back and told me to just come back in and she called my docs for the order. Keep in mind that was a year or so ago, before Covid when she had a bit more time on her hands I think to offer such customer service. I think that they have a lot of \"floats\" that bounce between locations, Michelle is not a float and stays at this location. Another great tech is I think Maria. Her and Michelle seem to work really well together and I like them both a lot. The rest of the techs I've dealt with can be hit or miss, most of them are friendly though at least. Michelle might get a lot of flack because I have noticed she doesn't tolerate any BS, and she has a bit of RBF if I am honest which can be intimidating.  I have seen people be upset with her for stating the facts when she is just doing her job. To me she is just a no non-sense person. \n\nThis lab used to be hardly busy, and I never had to make an appointment. Since Covid has happened, appointments are HIGHLY recommended. Anytime I come in now its busy outside, they are currently operating at 3 appts every 15 minutes so please be patient with them. I see a lot of reviews frustrated that they don't accept walks in after a certain time, or don't have appointments available for a week, that might just meant that THEY ARE SLAMMED. \n\nCall them ahead of time if you are wondering if they can draw your specific lab or not. I believe walk ins aren't accepted after 1:30 with covid currently. Which honestly that should be standard now anyways. Every business may not keep up their online hours, and temporary closings etc so it should be standard to call ahead.\n\nMake use of the online appointment feature and make an appt, the covid protocols are strict, so you get a text to \"check in\" once you are there, once they are ready to draw your labs, you get another text saying to come inside. \n\nif you do walk in, you check in digitally on the ipod and you can select to wait outside which is preferable as they have only a couple chairs out in the waiting room to comply with distancing. You can also see an estimate of the walk in wait time for each location online as well when you look at the Quest website. \n\nIts all very high tech and they have pretty great protocols I feel completely safe having to get labs drawn the techs wear masks and face shields.",

The first time we went, it felt like a great experience at the time, but I'm wondering if I was just so excited that I thought it was better than it actually is. The food quality seemed to go downhill from there and is definitely not on par with downtown. \n\nAmbiance: Pin-dropping quiet, light and clean, hints of trendiness but mostly just elegant. We are in our mid-30s and we are consistently the youngest group in there by far. \n\nDrinks: Decent variety and affordable by-the-glass wine options. Very affordable bottles of wine. M Special beer on tap!\n\nFood: Great selection at varying price points but everything I've had is a just a little...off. Chicken piccata, great flavor but overwhelmingly greasy; Jane Burger, yummy combination of flavors but they were out of buns the day I got it and it was weird on baguette; seafood pasta, good in theory but kinda soupy and pasta was overdone; coconut cake, delicious but I strongly believe it should be served with raspberry sauce to give it some flavor nuance rather than the thick and heavy creme anglaise. \n\nService: Hostess is calm and kind. We are always seated within a few minutes. Servers are attentive. \n\nThis place is a great alternative to the more raucous brewery in the same complex if you are looking for a quieter, more romantic setting. The prices for many of the items comparable and the food is fine. \n\n{Full disclosure: My fiancé and I had a bad experience trying to plan a private event here. The space is lovely but there was major miscommunication on the end of the restaurant which they refused to take responsibility for and did not respond kindly to until I gave them pretty extensive documentation that we had clearly communicated our needs up front. They ultimately apologized, refunded our deposit money, and even reimbursed our lost costs, but their initial response was upsetting and it took an unreasonable amount of time and back and forth to resolve. We will never be back to Jane because of this incident, but this is an honest review and rating of the restaurant in general without consideration for this isolated experience.  I did, however, think it was worth mentioning as feedback for the restaurant and as a heads up for potential private event customers. We hope that they learned from what happened with us and will help you have an amazing event at this beautiful location.}",

They're on GrubHub, but they've got their own online ordering platform as well! Pro Tip: Sign up for their mailing list and they often send out a 15% off coupon code when you order directly! \n\nVegetable Samosa [$3]\nVegetable turnovers, green peas, potatoes\n\nHad to start off with some samosa - there are two per order and surprisingly held up to delivery. Crisply fried, there was a smooth melange of potatoes and green peas within. A trio of chutneys were on offer including a sweet tamarind, herbaceous mint, and an onion chutney with some bite.\n\nPaneer Pakora [$5.75]\nCottage cheese fritters, cumin seed, Oriental spices  \n\nFor me, paneer in general is a bit underseasoned for my liking. But I couldn't help but order the dish anyway - because fried cheese amirite? Unfortunately, the crispness of the samosas didn't extend to this batter, which was more of a spongy, underseasoned bite that was barely helped by the chutneys that accompanied the samosas. I'd skip these. \n\nPaneer Masal Biryani [$11.50]\nRice, cheese cubes, nuts, raisins \n\nOn the other hand, the paneer featured in the masala biryana was spectacular as it soaked up the masala. The texture from the peanuts and the sweetness from the raisins brought it over the top. You can order your desired heat level from an entire spectrum of spice - we went with medium-plus and that had a perfect amount of kick that left you wanting some of the raita (whipped yogurt) on the side.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala [$11.25]\nChicken, onions, peppers, tomato and butter sauce\n\nNew Delhi offered a great rendition of chicken tikka, which the GF had to have. She ordered it at a medium spice level and it was still on the spicier side than the chicken tikka's she's used to. Regardless, the sauce was velvety and delicious on top of the accompanying basmati rice. Keep in mind the chicken features both white and dark for those of you that are particular about such things.\n\nGarlic Naan [$3.50]\n\nYou've got to have some naan to sop up all of the tomato-butter sauce, right? The garlic permeated throughout the gluttonous bread - the perfect vessel to your Indian on! \n\nKeema Naan [$3.95]\nMinced meat \n  \nThe Keema naan offered a different flavor profile, with the minced meat coming through to offer some nice savoriness to each bite.\n\nSo if you're aching for Indian food, New Delhi has definitely got you covered.

I don't have much to say about them because they all tasted the same. Is it just me or do ALL their flavors taste the same??\n\nRegardless, once I tried the strawberry shortcake, I finally found a flavor that didn't taste like the rest. I ordered it in a regular size bowl ($4.95), which is about two small scoops worth with a waffle cone piece attached. The waffle cone was fresh, but wasn't the best. The strawberry shortcake flavor had little chunks of shortcake dispersed throughout and LOTS of strawberry seeds, which I didn't mind since it added to the texture. \n\nOverall, they need to focus less on the fancy names and more on the flavor notes. These names tell me to take a dessert journey, yet I haven't moved an inch because all the flavors taste the same to me. Also, please put a menu on the T.V. screen, otherwise, it doesn't serve a purpose. I don't want to be forced to order because I have to go up to the counter to see the options and prices.

Food's good but everyone has a great time.  Meals are really large.  You don't actually need an entree and appetizer for everyone.  When Elphaba and I ate here, we had two appetizers, one entree, and could barely finish the dessert. Of course we stuffed ourselves on tasty corn muffins though.\n\nAll the appetizers are great.  \nShrimp and Alligator Sausage Cheesecake (like a quiche) excellent.\nFried Grits and the Eggplant Jacques-Imo's were awesome.\n\nFried Green Tomatoes were really really tasty.  Maybe my favorite of the appetizers.\n\nDinner: \nCarpet-Bagger Steak, Fried chicken, Flounder with Crabmeat, and Crawfish Etoufee all excellent.\n\nPaneed Duck was mediocre.  Bland and not good. Seemed like chicken fried steak only with duck.  The sweet potato sauce didn't really go quite right.  It seemed like the duck needed something to go with the sweet potato.  Balance was all wrong.  If I'd only had this, I would have been really disappointed. \n\nBread pudding so yummy.\n\nService was really good. Other people are right about the wait, but get a drink and sit outside.\n\nSecond time on someone else's account:\nSame story on the food.  Some items awesome others mediocre.  More random items weren't quite great this time. We liked that the chef has an MBA.  He came out all crazed up and got a picture with us. (If I didn't know better, I'd say he was on coke.) That was pretty fun.  He didn't like when I told him that that the food wasn't up to snuff the last time though.\n\nIn the end the experience is great, some items are great, but some items aren't good at all.  We did have lots of fun though.  Do people know that there are lots of restaurants in this town?   But everyone is so happy a group of lesbians next to us asked us if we'd like to try their dishes b/c we were only two and didn't get to try everything.  i don't think they were hitting on Elphaba and I know they weren't hitting on me.\n\nI'm shocked, however,  by the number of Yelpers who are from LA or NY  that say this is the place to get authentic Louisiana food.  Hmm. I hope they lived here or something before they talk about authentic.  By the way  alligator cheesecake isn't traditional Louisiana food.  Since I live in Mobile, AL I'm gonna come up and tell you which places have the best cheese slices.",

        "text": "My car was rear-ended and Collision Care was covered by my insurance. It happened to be the closest shop to my office, so the convenience factor led to my ultimate decision of picking Collision Care to do the work. \n\nThe pros:\n-They were very transparent with everything they did. Each part of the process was thoroughly explained to me, and I even got a daily update e-mail while my car was in the shop.\n-They dealt with my insurance directly for the estimate so I didn't have to do it.\n-Each staff member I interacted with was very friendly and nice. \n-My bumper looks fantastic and is under warranty now with them for as long as I have the car. \n-They frequently work with a nearby rental car company so all of my transportation to and from was handled between the two businesses. \n\nThe cons:\n-They are very busy. At the time I scheduled my appointment, they were booking about a month out.\n-They are located on a busy half residential, half commercial street. Their parking lot is basically the size of the drive-way, and there is constant traffic from locals and from the other businesses. It was tricky to navigate the street. \n\nFor my own convenience, I had Collision Care fix my car after the estimate. I could have taken the car elsewhere and I'm not sure how that would have been priced. Since insurance completely covered my claim, that wasn't a concern so I can't really speak to pricing. I dropped my car off on a Wednesday around noon and it was ready the following Tuesday around 2pm. I'm not sure if that's a long or short amount of time for my particular service. Due to my uncertaintly of pricing and length of service, as well as the cons above, I am giving them a 4. \n\nIn any event, I'm happy with my repair and experience, and would recommend their services.",

        "text": "I really like the ambiance and layout of the location. Lofty ceilings, sky light, hardwood tables/chair/floor, minimalist design, and fresh greenery make the space feel airy yet warm at the same time. It's also bustling with customers, servers, busers, and food runners so there's good energy in the place. \n\nWe had a group of 7 so I was able to make a reservation for one of three pre determined times: 9am, 11am, or 1pm. You need a minimum of 6 guests to use this feature otherwise you're just walking in and waiting for a table. You also need to provide a credit card when you make the reservation because if any of your guest doesn't arrive the rest of the group is on the hook for $10. Also if you don't show up for your reservation then the CC will get charged $10/person. You can cancel your reservation anytime without charge as long as it's not within the last 24 hours before your seating. \n\nSo after jumping through those hoops we arrived and the 9am group was still in the large table that could accommodate us. It's a semi private dining area that can seat up to 10 guests. We weren't seated until 11:25am. \n\nI had looked at the menu online and while we were waiting and I was honestly disappointed with the selection and options. The way I'd explain it is a fine dining brunch experience. Only 5 main courses to choose from (don't expect normal brunch offerings) and some smaller plates could be filling but were more simple. Our whole group are highly attuned to food from many angles: cooking, eating out, palate, ingredients, and flavor combinations. The food was unique but most of us had some issue with it: consistency, portion, seasoning, price, plating, etc. \n\nWhen I think about my complete experience I'm not sure I'd be back again for brunch or breakfast. There is so many good breakfast places that will offer more familiar items at a reasonable price and satisfy my hunger and palate. \n\nSince they are serving dinner I may try that out.",

        "text": "Still don't quite understand why my boss would have given me, a girl who doesn't eat seafood, a gift card to a seafood restaurant for Christmas, but since my old man and one of my daughters love seafood, it wasn't a total fail.  Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and had a nice time.  The seafood lovers enjoyed their choices - mahi tacos, some kind of seafood chowder, a salad with four different kinds of seafood on it, and of course, some oysters.  \n\nThere weren't many choices for me and my other daughter who is a vegetarian, but we enjoyed the vegetarian linguine provencal dish that we both got.  It was yummy and chock full of some of my faves - roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, asparagus and tons and tons of capers.  It was a nice size but for the price I would have liked to have gotten a side salad for just a few bucks more, instead of the $8 apiece we had to shell out for salads that consisted of just mixed greens, tomatoes, cukes and a few radishes. \n\nAt $110 including the tip, it was probably THE most expensive lunch we've ever had (luckily the gift card cut that almost in half) so considering the prices, the location (a bit out of the way for me), and the fact that there are literally only 3-4 non-seafood lovers can eat there, I highly doubt we'll ever go there again.  Oh, and like my husband said, most seafood restaurants don't offer complimentary bread or rolls like other restaurants, but it would have been nice.  A nice hot buttery roll would have been nice...",

As a reward from the race, we decided to go for Peruvian food for lunch, and boy, what a great and delightful choice that was!\n\nWe truly enjoy Peruvian food so we wanted to explore the menu offerings at this restaurant based on the information posted online.\nWe ordered the ceviche trilogy appetizer, simply wonderful, very tasty and perfectly prepared (see posted pictures). My husband decided to try other two Peruvian appetizers dishes instead of a main dish: Papas Rellenas (stuffed mashed potatoes with sautéed Vegetables served with red onions, avocado salad and salsa criolla), and the \"Causa Limeña\" (yellow potato cake with yellow peppers stuffed with shredded chicken). I had the \"Chaufa de Vegetales y Quinoa\" (wok stir-fried quinoa with fresh vegetables and scrambled eggs). Every dish was cooked to perfection and presentation was excellent. For dessert we shared the Quinoa flan, accompanied with a delicious caramel and fresh strawberries... to die for!!\nThe waiting staff was very attentive and friendly. We also had the pleasure of meeting Fausto, the restaurant owner (native from Peru), who kindly chatted with us and shared fond stories about the restaurant and his family.\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated with colorful tapestries and ornaments hanging on the walls. Furniture is simple and practical, overall great ambiance and service.\n\nWe highly recommend this great family-owned restaurant if you happen to be in the New Hope/Lambertville area and are interested in trying some excellent Peruvian food.",

        "text": "This is a personal experience review: \n\nUnless changes are made this place will not last the year. \n\nThis is not a review of the food or the beer. \n\nI intended to go here for dinner tonight a late affair around 7:15pm When I got to the door of the restaurant I was told they had run out of food and had closed the kitchen.  They also informed me that they still had an hour wait.\n\nIssues with the restaurant: \n\n1. They ran out of food ordinarily this is a good sign I would rather have a restaurant run out of food than have to fill a dumpster with food that was never served.  It is a bad sign when you run out of food with at least 3 hours to go in dinner service this shows that the management did not properly make a food order.  The hype around this restaurant goes back over a year.  So running out of food with 3 hours to go in service is not excusable.    \n\nOnly legal parking is on the street or the 7 spaces around the door of the restaurant.  There is a huge lot in the back but every single spot has a huge sign which say parking reserved for Penn Medicine Media all other cars will be towed.  The owners will need to make a deal with the Medical practice for the spaces which are directly behind the restaurant. On street parking is not that bad because of the County park up state street, and there are a few spaces on Baltimore Ave.  Because the on street parking is in a residential part of Media those space will probably not be available after working hours.  The county park and its lot closes at dusk and if the county in need of funds it could be a very easy ticket. The restaurant also has no handicapped spots.  though they have a ramp for handicapped clients.  \n\nI will update this review after the next time I dine.  I do hope I get a chance to go back and sample the beer and the food. I hope they remain in business It looks like Luic Barneau is still involved with the restaurant I wish him nothing but success.",

The locals and tourists alike are always enjoying themselves and having a great time with one another. You will see a lot of smiles, a lot of craziness, and you will laugh until you can't breathe and your belly hurts. \n\nThere are so many famous landmarks and places here from Bourbon St., to Canal St. and everywhere far and in between. New Orleans allows public drinking and believe me you will see your fair share of drunkards. They have a lot of street performers ranging from dancers to musicians to tarot card reading psychics. The bars are always open and almost everyone is walking around with a huge Hurricane drink. \n\nThere are some areas that are really dirty, too. Some areas smell horrible and the garbage is mounting. I wish the Quarter could be kept cleaner, but with so many people walking the streets and partying that's a tall order. \n\nSadly, there are a lot of homeless people who are either panhandling or sleeping or passed out in the middle of the street. It really hurts my heart to see this. I try to support some of the local artists while I'm here. \n\nDuring Mardi Gras season they have many parades and they really let the good times roll. Mardi Gras in the Quarter is insane. What people won't do for some plastic beads?! Haha. Just remember to watch for vomit and folks urinating. I know gross right? Also, Nola is notorious for its crime rates but you can have a really great time in Nola if you remember to stay alert and try to be safe. \n\nI enjoy all of the street performers and silliness that keeps The French Quarter strange and weird and beautiful. They have so many restaurants that smell great and cook up some yummy Cajun and Creole dishes, such as etouffee and gumbo. Also don't forget the beignets and coffee!  \n\nBourbon Street is so lively and it's always always packed. Parking anywhere in the Quarter is atrocious especially when they have events it's near impossible to park. Nola is a tourist city so you will likely have to pay almost anywhere you park. Trust me the city of Nola will get its money because you have to pay for everything here, haha. Please note to use caution because the cops whether in cars, motorcycles, or horses are out and about and they will ticket you, boot your car, or have it towed if you park in the wrong place. \n\nNew Orleans has the most incredible cemeteries you will ever see in your life. Most are massive and decaying and absolutely haunting. \n\nNola has so many shops ranging from touristy novelty stores to voodoo shops and adult shops. Many of the stores have very inappropriate trinkets and gag gifts and it's hilarious. \n\nThey have so many tours ranging from French Quarter tours to cemetery tours to ghost and vampire tours. I believe everyone should experience New Orleans and The French Quarter in their life.",

I have noticed that the places in Nashville that I like the best have low ratings and the places I like the least have high ratings. \n\nSo, it is quite possible that a native of Nashville will find this place delightful. \n\nI did not. \n\nWe arrived at noon on Sunday for brunch. We were a little worried that without reservations we would be waiting fiveevers. \n\nWhen we arrived, we found a half empty restaurant. You would think this would be good, but it made me wonder if the reviews we read were a little misleading. Prime brunching hour and no wait? This seems odd. They take reservations, but they aren't necessary for brunch. \n\nAmbiance - dark walls, comfortable chairs, a large patio and a huge iron horse inside a converted factory. I love reclaimed spaces. But I didn't love this one. It felt like a facsimile. Does this matter? Maybe not. But, it sort of sums up the restaurant for me. A close approximation of something gastronomically interesting, but really just a mediocre restaurant  dressed up in interesting architecture. \n \nParking - valet or street \n\nFood - \nMonkey bread with cream cheese icing. Sounds delicious, right? We were fooled, too. This tastes like I imagine paper does. It comes with an inexplicable sprig of rosemary. Cinnamon, icing and rosemary? Even the cream cheese icing was bland. How? \n\nFried chicken on a bed of something that had sweet potatoes. Another review indicates that there is cheaper, better fried chicken. That is true. This was $19. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the price. $19 for fried chicken doesn't really bother me. I get that restaurants are expensive to run. I just want my $19 fried chicken to be good. It wasn't. \n\nMimosa - there is no champagne in this. Prosecco, maybe. \n\nService - my partner and I shared both items. This is common for us. We have big eyes but small stomachs and we love to share. Two different servers seemed put off by this. Was that a smirk I saw? Yes, I believe it was. I won't be shamed into ordering more food than I want. So, it was a wasted smirk. Nevertheless, there are plenty of places for people who find American portions a little too generous for one to go and share without fear of side eye. \n\nMonkey bread, fried chicken, mimosa - $48 with tip.",

He was not friendly, did not really speak to the passengers, except to ask for tips. I cannot say if he was knowledgeable but he could use some remedial commercial driver training.

        "text": "It's been several years since I called Nashville home, but I must say that I've been pleasantly surprised by the food offerings during my recent visits.  This latest trip 'home' didn't disappoint.\n\nAfter introducing my Mom to Thai food during my college days, she graciously repaid me by suggesting that we visit this hidden gem.  Who knew that Nashville had decent Thai food?  Go figure...My Mom had never dined there before but said she'd heard rave reviews from friends and co-workers.  Once I read some of the positive reviews on Yelp, that was enough for me!\n\nThanks to my fellow Yelpers I was prepared for a long wait.  Suffice to say, it was a seriously long wait, even though it was raining buckets outside and you'd expect people to 'stay in' for the evening.  I had called ahead and confirmed that this was a strictly 'No Reservations' establishment, so there was really no avoiding the wait.  I was also prepared for the fact that the dining area was small.  I mean seriously SMALL.  If you're claustrophobic, then you'd best get your order 'To go'.  Being the friendly folks that we are, we didn't mind rubbing elbows with our neighboring diners too much.\n\nDespite the long wait to be seated, our burly (but super friendly) server took our order quickly and patiently answered our questions and offered decent recommendations (i.e., go with the Lump Crab).  After placing our order, I must say the food came out pretty fast.  As for the food, we ordered Fresh (spring) Rolls, Pad Thai w/Shrimp, Pad Kra Pao (basil) Chicken and  Thai Fried Rice w/Lump crab. Had our tiny table not already been overflowing with food, I would've ordered Panang Curry, which was their 'Curry of the Day'  Fyi - We dined on a Saturday night. \n\nOverall the food was very tasty. Although the place is famous for their 'non-Americanized' Pad Thai, the Thai Fried Rice w/Lump Crab was the true star of the night.  The entree was truly overflowing with Lump Crab.  I mean it seriously came with TONS of crab.  It was really delish.  I also liked that the Pad Kra Pao came with a fried egg - I thought it was a unique touch that I'd not experienced in a 'basil chicken' dish before.  Plus, it was darn tasty.  My Mom wasn't crazy about the fried egg component. C'est la vie.\n\nI must admit to one serious error in judgement.  Against the sound advice of other Yelpers, I made the unfortunate decision to order Gelato for dessert.  I have no excuse.  On some deep level, I knew better.  I blame the quasi food coma state that I was in.  Suffice to say that  I must echo other Yelpers and warn against trying their Gelato.  Really, just stay away from it, please.  It reminds me of what would happen if someone accidentally spilled corn meal into their lowfat ice cream.  It had a mealy consistency and the flavor (or lack there of) just couldn't compensate.  If you must have ice cream for dessert, you should venture elsewhere.\n\nMealy ice cream/gelato aside, I do recommend this place.  Although it wasn't the 'best' Thai food I've ever had, it was pretty tasty and I left with a happy, full belly.",

Great unique items you can pickup from local crafters, some alligator on a stick, books, a foodie paradise - lots of spices, fresh seafood - you name it, they have it! And you wouldn't spend a ton of money - unless you wanted to - getting some goodies here.\n\nThat was every trip we've had, except this one. Understandably after Katrina some things have changed, and I'm not sure if the Market had changed for the better.\n\nYes, it is updated and looks newly remodeled. It is cleaner. \nThey've added an entire strip of restaurants along the center so you can sit down and enjoy some food while you're out shopping. \n\nBut, something got taken away when it was redone. And that was it's uniqueness. EXTREMELY touristy now - Yes, I'm sure locals do not come here and it is a tourist trap! - but it had me thinking back on why I don't visit the inside of Navy Pier back at home - cattle herd, hot, stuffy and there were some rude people. \n\nNothing in the craft section stood out to me. All of the same. No unique jewelry or art, seemed like every booth sold masks, tshirts and some other odd and ends. Things I could get at Jazz Funeral across the street - better selection and cheaper over there.\n\nWas pretty disappointed.\n\nThe shops on the outside of the market, are still the same...some great candy shops, unique gift shops and some interesting art. But I recommend staying out of the market itself. \n\nWe did eat at one of the little restaurants that are now setup, and that was a disaster. Ordered a pound of crawfish and a dozen of the charbroiled oysters. Was told 15 minutes - which worked okay, got us a place to sit...cattle herded through the market to use the bathrooms and came back.\nA good 45 minutes later - still no food. And there was an older couple who was there a good amount of time before us, and still didn't have theirs. \n\nWhen it finally came out - about 15 minutes after that! - our crawfish were mostly heads - um! Did you guys use the tails for the other platter you serve?! The oysters were good - and fresh - but by time we got it, was mad, tired, hot and pretty p'd off. \nAt least be honest about the time, so it gives us that chance to decide if we wished to wait an hour or not. \n\nJust added to the madness and I think we'll skip out on doing the Market next time we're down. Much more unique things found outside of there and better food too - wasn't like the food was cheap either! The pier is still beautiful and worth checking out, but if you're looking for gifts, check elsewhere. You'd be glad you did.",

        "text": "We hadn't eaten Mongolian BBQ in a long, long time, but Husband got the idea in his head that nothing would do for dinner except a self-styled meat bowl, so away we went.  It only took me about five minutes to remember why, exactly, we hadn't been into a Genghis Grill in so long.\n\n1)  Atmosphere.  The seating isn't much better than a fast-food joint, and between that and the corporate-scripted service, I kind of feel that I'd rather this all just be a serve-yourself kind of place with a tip jar for the grill operators.  Except then I guess you wouldn't be able to order the fish bowl full of alcohol.  Also, the decor theme here is ad-chic.  Everywhere you look are big, glaring posters shouting at you to EAT HERE JOIN OUR FREQUENT DINER CLUB EAT HERE.  I'm here already...you don't need to beat me over the head with it.  Other posters dictate the many rules of bowl construction: DO NOT PUT MEAT ON TOP OF VEGGIES YOU WILL BE CHARGED EXTRA.  Even in the bathroom stalls:  EATHEREEATHEREEATHERE.  Just stop.  Stop already.\n\n2)  The price.  You have to spend a lot of money for the privilege of constructing one bowl.  No AYCE, no discount on a second bowl...you get one shot.  I'm not saying that a large isn't enough food; if you pile that sucker up--and I mean really, really stuff the food in there until heaping--you should get enough food to satisfy.  But what if you make a mistake?  What if you create a monstrosity of ingredients that just doesn't taste good?  Well, kiss your money goodbye.  I don't prefer AYCE because I want to eat the company into bankruptcy; I want AYCE so that I can experiment with multiple small combinations.  As is, the pressure to fit $15 worth of food into a tiny metal dish overrides any kind of culinary creativity that Mongolian BBQ should provide.\n\n3) The line.  It wasn't terribly crowded when we were there, but I imagined what it must be like when it is.  Even with only three other people in line with me, the lady behind me was nudged up into my personal space breathing down my neck because apparently I wasn't moving fast enough for her.  Then, when I got to the grill, the guy took my bowl and my card and shooed me away.  I remember long ago with my first Mongolian BBQ experience, how fun it was to create your bowl and then watch the griller cook it up.  None of that here.  GO SIT DOWN WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU.  It all just starts to feel that you are in a cafeteria.  And not the good kind of cafeteria where you get to have fun choosing all different foods, but the institutional kind where you step forward, take what you're given, and move along.\n\nWhen we got the check, it suddenly occurred to me that the Island Buffet at the Peppermill has a Mongolian grill.  I did the math and realized that our bill at Genghis Grill (with NO drinks, desserts or appetizers--bowls only) was only $5 less than it would have cost for us to eat at the buffet--as much food as I want, with drinks and desert included.  Suffice to say, I think it will be another long stretch of time before we ever set foot in another Genghis Grill.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Looks like Peppermill does NOT have a Mongolian grill (did they used to? I'm not sure), but Toucan Charlie's in Atlantis definitely DOES.",

Learned that when you eat there in the restaurant, they bring you a free basket of breadsticks.\n-Decor. They display their positive/cute comment cards that people have written.\n\nThe bad:\n-Service. Husband went up to order the food and I didn't see him for 10 minutes. Literally. He came back and said he seriously considered leaving and going somewhere else for dinner before staff finally took his order.\n-Atmosphere. A certain staff member behind the counter apparently could not stop singing along with the radio or whatever music they had playing in the background. Although her voice was not absolutely terrible, it quickly became incredibly obnoxious after the first couple of minutes. She continued to do this throughout our entire meal there.\n\nOverall, I liked the food, but in the future I would either eat at a different location or order take out.",

Salt toasted squid -  fresh, tender, and seasoned just right.  The jalapenos were  flavorful, but not too spicy.  3 votes for favorite dish.\n\n2.  Salt fish chicken eggplant.  This dish comes in a hot clay pot with fire, but we ordered it without the fire. Good combination with fresh Chinese eggplant.  2 votes.\n\n3,  Peking style pork chops - tasty with a great depth of flavor.  The sauce and cooked onions were great with rice. 2 votes.\n\n4.  Seafood pan fried noodle - Nice combination of fresh seafood.  Daughter who is the connoisseur of fried rice surprised us by voting this dish as her favorite dish.\n\n5. West lake beef soup -  this one is not on the menu.  Beef, cilantro, and egg whites in a rich broth.  Very delicious.  1 vote.\n\nWe also ordered combination fried rice, sauteed sweet pea leaves, and con-gee.  The con-gee was my least favorite, but most enjoyed it.",

        "text": "Came here mainly for the BBQ Shrimp based on recommendations from locals who said it's better than the original at Pascal's. I've never had \"the original BBQ Shrimp\" so I can't compare it to that one, but Mr. B's Barbequed Shrimp is BOMB! It's buttery... it's peppery... it's absolutely delicious! It reminds me of a New Orleans version of Hawaiian garlic butter shrimp, which is one of my favorite dishes! Shrimp lovers... this is a definite MUST TRY! \n\nAnother dish we got was the Gumbo Yaya. A local recommended it to me. It was good, but it left a bitter aftertaste. Generally though, I'm not a big gumbo fan (I prefer etouffee), so I may be a little biased. \n\nOverall, the restaurant is nice and elegant. Service was good but a little confusing because there wasn't just one server. I don't even know who our server was because of multiple servers coming to our table for different things. It's not a bad thing, just confusing. Anyway... BBQ SHRIMP! Go!",

I do have a gripe and that is that their prices are higher here than the ones in california. so it isnt as good of a place to shop. But seriously where else are you going to find kale chips that were not made in a home kitchen in this town. they have very high quality produce but you are going to pay for it! Cheapest tomatoes I saw there were $3/lb as compared to $.49/lb (roma vs roma) at sprouts were they better at whole foods hell yeah were they $2.51/lb better probably not easily $1 better maybe $1.50 but not 600% more expensive. I do love their cheese section. However when it comes to the pizza, well, my recommendation is to pass on it. My GF says the fish section is good, I hate fish so i have little opinion on them but i can say they dont stink like most fish depts.\n\n I am annoyed how you leave through some doors you think is an exit only to find yourself stuck in an outdoor eating area. Any ways I will keep going to sprouts and occasionally hitting the whole foods, unless I am California.",

The only thing I didn't like was the room temperature onion rings, wanted it hot.\n\nThe SERVICE (3.5/5): I would've liked to have been checked on besides just taking our order and delivering our meals...service needs a little more work tbh & this also happened previously when my hubs & I got a bottle of wine to share. \n\nThe MARTINI ON FIRE (5/5): It has a pinch of habanero flavor, so you can taste it but not spicy, really good & well worth the price!",

        "text": "Enjoyed my dermaplane, peel, waxing and lash lift done by Lauren. She was very easy to be around, and treated me like a friend (which is what some of us need sometimes....ahem, full time moms who don't socialize often). I had a great experience on the spa side.\n\nI've always had issue with the front of the house with this place. I get that it's a busy salon and that they are booked, but I don't need to be constantly reminded of it every time I try to schedule something (there is always some type of remark like, \"we're really busy\")... okay.... I get it, you're popular, all I need to know is your availability . I get my hair done at G Micahel salon (same caliber/popularity IMHO) and never get this vibe. \n\nThough, that's not why I'm giving 4 stars. I must blind, but I didn't see anything about not being able to tip on card. When I went to pay, i noticed there wasn't a tip line, and I asked about it... they said they don't take tip on card. I told the girl that I would have to run to the bank and come back, but luckily I had cash on me for once. Though it was only $30 on a $200 service, not a 20% tip that was deserved. It's super inconvenient not to be able to tip on the card. If this is stated somewhere, It should be more visible, or at least told when making an appointment. This kind of stuff causes me anxiety, the exact opposite of what I need when I'm going in for a spa treatment ‍.\n\nTried to book a pedicure, but they didn't have the service I wanted. I saw the seating they had for pedicures and it didn't look very comfortable... I saw a review on that, so I probably dodge a bullet on that one.",

        "text": "This review is kind of split in two: the actual dealership and the service center. \n\nMy wife and I bought a new Toyota here about 2 years ago, and the experience was great. The dealership is super clean, comfortable, and has very easy access to it since it's right off Broadway. Buying was super easy, and not once did we feel like we were being sold to. We traded both of our cars in, and they even let us leave the lot with the new one without being in our second until the next day. \n\nHowever, once you get past the dealership and into the service center, it's a whole new story. My wife and I used to bring our car here to get the oil changed, but after the first couple times took 2+ hours, we only come here if we absolutely need to or if it's a Toyota specific part. The customer service people here are actually really nice and professional, but there seems to be a monster lack of communication between workers. I've had situations where I bring my car in and am told it'll be ready to be picked up in the morning, never get a call that it's ready, and when I call them they tell me they haven't even started on it and won't be able to soon so I can just come back and get it. Then when I tell them I'll be there to pick it up right away, I end up sitting for an hour waiting for an hour for somebody to simply pull it around. The last time I was in there, I picked up my car after having dropped it off because they didn't have the part handy, and said they'd call in a couple days when they got it. Never got a call (it's almost a month later), so I took it somewhere else.\n\nI'd rather pay a tiny bit more somewhere else to have my stuff fixed in a timely manner than to keep having to bring it here.",

As long as the patient was capable of receiving guests, we were allowed to visit.\n\nThe facility feels like a blend between a hotel and a well planned medical facility.  It ran smoothly, quietly, peacefully.  \n\nGreat communication and bed side manner from all staff.  \n\nArt and thoughtful inspirational quotes on the walls, sitting chairs well placed in front of windows in hall ways throughout the building. Rooms are cleverly designed to provide maximum access to the patient and equipment and maximum comfort for visiting relatives who practically live there with the patient.  The suites have places to lay down and sleep in the same room as the patient with a curtain for privacy, a mini fridge, free wi-fi access, power outlets and task lighting everywhere.\n\nThe floors have a unique design, invented by the hospital staff that created a very good flow, easy to navigate and equipment readily available at all times without feeling like a cold hospital.  When a chest X-Ray was ordered, a machine was wheeled into the room within the hour.\n\nWe went through very difficult decisions and milestones in this hospital.  The doctors and nurses talked to us on our level so that we could understand what was happening and the consequences of the various decision to be made.  We weren't rushed, though they were persistent in pressing to get important and extremely difficult decisions made while they still could be.  They didn't beat around the bush, they were direct yet gentle.  How in the world they learn this art, I have no idea.  Family members who have had a lot of experience with hospitals were overwhelmed by the dialogue we were able to have during our family meetings with hospital staff.  It was like nothing they've experienced before.\n\nI would definitely recommend this hospital.",

This fast food establishment is fresh, healthy, low fat and delicious. No processed food here.  You order at the counter and they prepare your food right in front of you. You pay and find a table. I have only had the fresh spring rolls. They have so many to choose from. My faves are the kickin chicken roll, avocado roll, barbeque pork roll and the tuna. They are filled with fresh veggies, herbs and the protein. They also have a few rice noodles within them, however I omit the noodles and have them replace it with more  romaine lettuce.  They offer a variety of sauces to dip them in. They also offer salads. pho soup and banh mi which I have heard excellent comments about. I am so hooked on the rolls I have yet to venture  to the rest of the menu. During the downtown lunch rush the line can scare you however they get you thru the line quickly. If you only have an hour for lunch it still rushes you. We order online or by phone then go straight to the register for pick up.\n\nDuring dinner Bamboozle offers sit down service and they have a full menu with beer and wine. \n\nThe service overall is lacking. They are not rude or offensive they are bland in how they deal with you as a customer. That is disappointing and that is what keeps them from receiving 5 stars from me. In fact,  I would give a 3.5 if I could all because of their lack of caring. \n\nThe Bamboozle Tea Room is in Channelside and does not get nearly as busy. It's charming and overall has a better relaxed feel to it.. Service is still the same and is slow here. We still order in advance if short on time.  I'm not sure however I think their menu is the same for lunch and dinner. It's a shorter version of the downtown property. \n\nWe are regulars. Twice a week sometimes 3.",

(See overview section at the bottom for the skimming version)....\n\nAmbiance: The owners really outdid themself with this space. The colors are vibrant, the neon lights are classic for Asian street food, and the vibe is trendy, cool, and lounge-y (not a word I know). What is neat about the artwork is that the company chooses local artists to paint the murals that you see throughout the hallways and the side of the building. The host told us that they try to do this for ALL the locations. I will say that since it is the \"hot new\" restaurant in town, it is quite crowded. I think they are skirting with the guidelines for Covid, but I didn't feel unsafe or felt exposed. All staff were wearing their masks correctly, except for a couple of bartenders where. Their masks were just covering their mouths. \n\nDrinks: WATCH WHAT BARTENDER YOU GET!!!! Each drink I tried (OG Pain Killer, Margari-Thai, and the Malaysian Mule) were sweet all around. HOWEVER, they do have spicy foods so it was a nice complement to cut the heat. Some of them are poured in Tiki glasses (see picture). The Malaysian Mule was my favorite drink. Now I say watch what bartender you get because we asked one lady to make our drinks and it took her a loooonng time to get our drinks and didn't fill the drinks up all the way. My advice???? Wait until you get a table OR make sure you go to the designated spot to get your drinks. \n\nService: The service was pretty amazing, from the host to the server. The host guided us well to where we can go to wait for our table and how to get drinks while we wait. The wait was a LOT quicker than they told us which was a pleasant surprise. When seated, the host told us about the history of the company and about the local artists they hire to create the ambiance. Our waitress directed us to the best options with food and drinks and was very attentive. Since the food was more tapas/family-style like, she made sure she picked up any empty dish to make more room for food.\n\nFood: THE FOOD!!!! Apart from the cool vibe and the great service (which I'm a stickler for), the food made this review a 5-star rating. Every dish we ordered was packed with flavor! From spicy-sweet, to soy sauce, to the curry.....mmmmmhmmmmmm....it's really all I can say. Note that the food comes out as prepared (normal Asian culture). So pick a couple of things to get you started and continue to order as need be. My favorite dishes were the chicken dumplings, bulgogi beef skewers and the Seoul Hot Chicken Steamed Baos (also not really spicy....but a sweet-spicy).\n\nOverview: If you are looking for a new trendy spot in Nashville, definitely try Hawkers. You will NOT be disappointed...from the ambiance to the FOOOODD! Every dish we got was full of flavor and just scrumptious. Service...10/10 with their recommendations and telling us about the history of the company. Now since it is new and trendy, it doesn't get busy. No reservations are taken, but there is plenty of room to wait and you can order drinks from the bar while you wait. They seem to be following Covid guidelines, but the tables DO seem a little close. You can also order takeout as well. OH AND THERE IS PARKING!! It is a small parking lot, but there is parking with the entry behind the building. \n\nEnjoy!! We will definitely be back.",

It was lunchtime, and we were seated immediately. From the outside, I expected it to be a small place, but it was a lot deeper than I thought. \n\nThey brought warm rolls, and there was olive oil and red pepper flakes on the table. Mix those with a little salt and pepper and you've got a great dip for the bread. The only thing that would have made it better is if there were grated cheese on the table as well.\n\nWe ordered the individual salad to share, thinking that based on the price, it was going to be big enough to share, and it certainly was. It was a large salad, likely meant to be a meal in itself. It was more than enough to split.\n\nWe also ordered a medium pizza with meatballs and ricotta. The brick oven crust was cooked well, the meatballs were good, the ricotta wasn't just plain, but had some spices and stuff mixed into it, which just added to the flavor. The mozzarella was stringy, and the basil on top was a nice touch. \n\nOur server, Christine, was friendly, polite, efficient, and competent. She had a way of dropping drink refills and picking up the empties as she was passing by, without us ever needing to ask. A couple check-ins to make sure we were all set. Perfect.\n\nThe only negative I can really point out is the noise level. It was unbelievably loud, a mix of kitchen, chatter, and echo. It was lunchtime, and the place was busy, but not completely packed. Perhaps when it's full it might be quieter, but be prepared. If I lived in the area, I could see my self being here often.",

Anyway, what I am saying is, 4 is very high praise. I love: the decor, atmosphere, staff, and food, particularly the new pared down version of the menu. The datil, scallops, bikini, Gilda and secreto are tops for me but I also love the coliflor... It is just very rich and filling so have lots of people to share with. Charcuterie and cheeses are worthwhile. Really, everything is and the staff, we have found, is particularly helpful at helping make choices. We have had the paella once and it was good but with just two or four of us usually we like more variety. My mom used to make a delicious seafood paella so I am a little more fond of her version. It's wonderful for a romantic date, and I'm not a romantic, but also for entertaining friends when they visit. They are inevitably pleased with the evening. Favorite cocktail for me is the Costa Blanca but they occasionally have a special cocktail for special occasions... The Father's day loquita take on a whisky our was also delicious.",

They had given my food to someone else 20 minutes ago and had to remake my order.  45 minutes for Gyros and hummus for takeout.  Not even an apology.\n\nIf I had to add anything else to the \"bad\" list, it would be the lack of onions or tomato on the gyros.  I am a carnivore, but I like a little raw onion bite with my gyros.  Also, I like the concept of the Gyro being served in a pita pocket, but the sandwich tends to fall apart before you are done.",

        "text": "I have always wanted to try a traditional dim sum with cart table service. I love dim sum menu items, but that doesn't give the whole experience. Dim Sum is served here on weekends from 11-2:30.  As I walked I in with my dad we were asked if we were in for dim sum, my dad had no clue what we were doing so I answered yes. We were immediately seated and ordered our drinks. The waters arrived soon after ordering and the carts started flowing directly after. \n\nThe first cart came with a bunch of proteins and vegetables. I wish there was more time for them to describe the dishes or have a menu that described  each item for us. As this was a new experience for my dad and I, we had no idea what we should order or what we were ordering, but I guess that is part of the fun of it. We went with the bbq pork and roasted duck, as I am not a huge seafood fan. A second cart followed seconds after, we chose the scallion pancakes as our \"vegetable\". Before we could even take our first bite, a third cart came by so me decided to choose one more dish. The pork shumai was our dumpling sample. The fourth and final cart also stopped, but we were not prepared to  order from there just yet. \n\nIt was nice that the food was immediately served after being seated, as we were very hungry since it was 1:30. The food that should be hot were also given to us fresh and not from the cart. The bbq pork were my dad's favorite dish. It was sweet and tender. I enjoyed the duck's flavor and it fell off the bone. I did with there was more meat and less bone on the plate, but the skin was crisped and flavorful. The duck was also served with a side of pickled daikon and carrots. These were so enjoyable that we were dipping the shumai into the remaining vinegar juices. The shumai reminded me of a pork meatball wrapped in a dumpling, which sounds pretty good to me. The scallion pancakes had wonderful flavor. My only complaint about the pancakes is that they were much more tough than I remember as typical with this dish. \n\nAfter finishing our main meal, we were content with 4 dishes for 2 people, but we did call the fourth cart back over. This cart had fried shrimp, pork buns, pork wrapped in pastry, egg custard tarts, pineapple buns, sesame balls, and many other  desserts. We gave the pineapple buns a try. We only really needed one to split, but the order came with 3. This was my favorite part of the meal! The texture was addicting with a sweet bun similar to a baked donut, topped with a cracklin topping like what you would find on a cream puff, filled with a sweet custard, and garnished with sesame seeds. It wasn't quite as pineapple flavored as I expected and I didn't mind that at all. Each dish was about $5 - $7, but you do not know until they stamp your receipt. \n\nI will be returning and treat others to the experience!",

        "text": "Midtown.  Hipster capital of Reno.  Appropriate place for this restaurant.  Located on S. Virginia, right in the middle of all of it.  Dimly lit with cool music blasting from the speakers and very simple decor.  We drove from down South to check it out since my wife and I were looking for something new.\n\nGreeted right away when we walked in and there were available tables.  Tables are small, considering you'll be ordering a number of small plates but staff service is great and they are conscious of the lack of square footage; they clear your plates quickly and bring new ones promptly.  Yes, another small plates place.  Great way to try a number of dishes without rolling out of the restaurant afterwards.  I'd call the food Asian fusion Tapas.  There are poke/sashimi dishes, fried dishes, grilled dishes, combination dishes, small vegan plates, ramen.  The ramen selections can be ordered as a whole meal or split amongst all at the table.\n\nWe tried the ahi tuna poke with seaweed and lotus root chips.  I'm not a lotus root fan but cut thin and fried like they do it?  Actually pretty tasty.  I'd actually eat a bag.  Great Asian substitute for the usual homemade potato chips other restaurants offer with their tartare or poke plates.  Fish was fresh and everything else in the bowl brightened up the taste as well.  So many components, I couldn't pick it apart to tell what all they put in it but, together?  Good harmony.  We loved it.\n\nNext, we tried the lamb gyoza with mint/edamame puree and pickled cucumber.  When I said fusion, I'll bet you thought I meant East/West fusion, didn't you?  How 'bout East/Middle East fusion.  Sounds weird but it works.  Tender ground lamb with Moroccan spices in a gyoza/potsticker pouch, pan-seared and steamed as usual.  Pasta was just right and the meat tender, juicy and flavorful.  Great combo with the mint chiffonade and that creamy puree.  Pickled Japanese cucumber helped cut the fat.  Another thumbs up.\n\nNext, Salmon kushiyaki.  Grilled salmon over a potato paper with avocado.  Salmon was grilled well, moist, tender and flaky.  Maybe a little under seasoned.  Well complimented with the avocado.  Probably the least creative of the dishes we had tonight but nicely done.  Wish I knew that potato sheet underneath was edible while I was eating the salmon.  Would have been a nice crunchy texture contrast to add.  Not bad, but I will probably choose something else next time.\n\nEnded the meal with the spicy miso ramen with organic chicken.  Ramen with all the usual suspects.  Hot, steamy, chock full o' noodles.  Ramen noodle texture was perfect.  This is a spicy one but also very tasty.  In fact, I hogged up all the broth on this one.  If you were concerned about leaving the restaurant hungry after small plates, this is where you make up for the slack.  Delicious and satisfying.  I contemplated ordering one more dish but not after we finished this dish.\n\nOverall, this is a very hip joint in the hipster-est part of Reno.  Great energy in the restaurant and bar, simple but inviting atmosphere.  Our server was super helpful with the menu and we were in and out of there quick as we wanted to be.  Loved the food.  It is definitely stuff you can't get just anywhere.  It can get a bit pricey.  We ordered 4 dishes for two of us which was enough and were out $100 after tip.  Anyway, I encourage anyone to step a little out of your comfort zone and check it out.  You may see me 'cause i'll probably be back.",

The alarm clock is some crazy Bluetooth hybrid that charges your phone and doubles as a speaker you can play anything you want through.\n\nThings I Don't Like About The Logan.\n\n1. They aren't great at communication. I specifically left word at the front desk for them to give my brother a key when he arrived (late, as always). Somehow, there was no record of that, which cost me a little sleep. \n\n2. The valet fee is $55/day. I don't drive a lot, but am I wrong in thinking that's absurd? I feel as though parking should be included when you stay at a hotel of this caliber. And even if it isn't, I feel like the service needs to be faster if I'm paying $55/day + tips for valet parking. And if it does happen to cost the ridiculous amount of $55/day, they should pay the valet guys (who obviously work hard) enough and tell us customers that they make good wages, and not to worry about tipping. Maybe they do pay them well enough, but there was no notice I could find, so we were still tipping them on top. You know, because we aren't animals. \n\nSolid hotel, though.\n____________\n\n*Hotwire.com.\n**Still not affordable, really. But better than some.",

We started off the dinner with a couple of the specialty drinks.  We liked the cucumber Collins the most and a close second was the bees knees.  Then we got the lemongrass shrimp boil as an app. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked.  Very unique and delicious. We also got the boudin egg rolls.  I love boudin, so I really enjoyed this.   Even if boudin isn't your cup of tea, I think anyone would enjoy this starter.  For entrees we got the skirt steak, the hamburger, the braised pork roast and the pork tenderloin sandwich.  The steak was a 10 oz cut for I think $20.  We ordered it medium rare and guess what, it came out medium rare.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned and a deal for a good cut.  The hamburger and pork sandwich were also really good.  In all honesty, the pork tenderloin was probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in recent memory.  Very tender.  Burger was large and cooked medium, as requested.  Very good.  The braised pork was a huge portion and very good.  The meat fell apart and was very flavorful.  After tasting all of the entrees, I can say that I would order all four again.  Then came the desserts.  We got the blueberry cobbler and the boozy cakes.  We loved both.

        "text": "Sunday, July 12 we had a reservation for 5:00pm. I called to say we would be about five minutes late, and I was informed that it was not a problem. Once my boyfriend and I showed up, we stood at the door for about five minutes before being seated, all the while noticing that only about three of the about 10 tables were actually full. Once seated, at our communal table, we instantly started looking at the drink menu, as we both love to try new drinks... we did not get any service until my friends had arrived about ten minutes later, and I mean nothing. When our server finally greeted us, we put in the drink order. I requested Tanqueray and soda with a splash of grapefruit juice, as none of their house cocktails looked overly appealing. They did not have grapefruit juice, so I settled for some Orange San Pellegrino with it. The other three at the table ordered different beers. \n\nOur server came back to take our appetizer order about another ten minutes after dropping off our drinks, and with the slow service (at a half-full restaurant) I figured it was probably best to order a second drink before I finished my first, so I did... The server asked \"would you like the same thing?\" and I responded quite clearly with my \"yes, please\". Ten minutes later our appetizers come. We got the Whipped Goat Ricotta, Arancini, and the Fried Short Rib - all of which were absolutely perfect and delicious (if you don't like your crostinis too crunchy, I would request lightly toasted). My boyfriend and friend had both ordered another drink while the server was at our table. Mine was empty, but I figured the second one was on it's way. \n\nThe server returned with the two drinks for my company and took down our dinner choices... I could tell my boyfriend was going to ask about my drink, so I saved him the trouble... and like I had never asked for another one previously, the server asked the same question, in the same condescending tone- \"would you like the same thing?\". At this point, I am confused. He either is an awful person or he sincerely believes that, maybe the only other front of house staff that night brought out my drink while he wasn't looking and he never noticed my empty glass the last couple of times he visited my table. I figured I will check to see if I got charged for another one when the bill comes. \n\nMy second drink finally arrived and he came to clear most of our appetizer plates while we still munched on the goat cheese. About ten minutes later, I ordered another drink... But I made a mistake this time, as I asked him and the bartender to make me something delicious and fruity, stating that he knows I like orange, gin and soda, so anything a little less boring than that, but fruity and delicious would be great. Our food came, and I don't believe one of us had a single complaint about it. Their food is delectable and in small portions which is great and hard to come by these days. \n\nThis is where I decided that I will NEVER go back to this restaurant as long as they employ unknowledgable pompous child-like adults. I received my drink. Our server went ahead and ordered the Boulevardier for me off of the menu...probably in case I couldn't read when I was looking at that drink menu earlier and didn't order one of their three cocktails. I can't tell you exactly what is in it, but it involved Bourbon and Aperol. Not sure if you know what that is, but it basically taste like a bitter orangy glass of scotch... Not quite the fruity drink I was looking for. I wouldn't have complained had he asked... You know, I would simply say, no worries, I had a glass of scotch on Friday... It's awful, but I can handle it. But it was actually just that- he never asked. That is what blew me away. I have tried many random drinks and let the bartender at many places make me a surprise cocktail and I have never had one so awful for my taste or request. But what baffled me was that he could not care less whether or not I was satisfied with my \"surprise\" drink off the menu, and he did come back to the table about three more times before I finished and ordered the worst Martini of my life (the boyfriend asked me not to even finish the Martini because it was so poorly made). Anyway, we ordered some dessert and some double shots of espresso to enjoy after our meal and I realized when the bill came that my drink was not rung in an extra time, so our server must have just assumed I was not actually wanting another drink until mine had been empty for 10-15 minutes.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend people try this food. It is unbearably delicious - especially the appetizers. But as for me, thank you to the man who served us, I will not be returning any time soon. My boyfriend and I dine out at least 3 nights a week and this is quite literally the worst service I have ever received.",

It was a Wednesday night, the place was less than half full, and there was a hostess, a bartender, two servers, and two bussers/runners on the floor at various times, so they shouldn't have been overwhelmed. In my experience the first line of defence against this sort of error is a good hostess, to follow up and make sure the servers she assigns tables to are covering them, but it could have been the server being slow, or overloaded, as well. Either way the wait was a long one. Once our order was taken the server was genuinely friendly and helpful, but the food and drinks were still slow to arrive, and my pizza, which I had asked to be delivered at the end of our meal (\"to go\" for later consumption), was under cooked.\n\nNext, the average...\n\nPrices were reasonable. Portion sizes, on average, were good, though the Halibut anticucho I nicknamed the \"anti mucho\" as it was fairly undersized, even by anticucho standards.

The quality and freshness of the ingredients were matched by the chef's skill in preparing them. The bartender is world class, with an excellent and unique selection of very well thought out and prepared \"House Specialty\" cocktails.

Well if it is or if it isn't the Dancing Donut is here.   \n\nFor me, the basics of donuts are that the cake isn't overly oily, that it is fluffy, and if possible, has a bit of crunch on the crust.  Dancing donut hits all the marks here.  \n\nOf course being a hipster place, it has unusually flavored donuts and names constructed of grimace-inducing bad puns.    That said, the \"Cherrie Bradshaw\" is pretty friggin good.  And I hate the show from which they take the name.  The filling tastes like real cherries and is nice and tart.   The James Brown (I forget the actual name) is pretty good, too.  I like the bitterness of the cocoa and the filling isn't cloyingly sweet.  That is generally a strong point all around here--the donuts aren't so sweet you want to inject insulin after eating them (as many donuts are).  One exception, in my book, would be the ET.  Peanut butter icing/ganache is always a tall order--and here it was a bit sweet for my taste.   They should cut back on the sugar and let the peanuts carry more of the flavor load.   \n\nI can't wait to go back and try the old-fashioned \"Arthur Murray.\"   \n\nWill this place put Long's out of business?  No--and who would want that anyway--but this is a great additional donut shop in Indianapolis.  The city could use a few more like it!",

She brought us several samples of beers and had some excellent recommendations.\n\nFoodwise, I ordered the crab cake special appetizer - so good, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his French onion soup, as well as his skirt steak entrée.  But the scallops I ordered? Pan seared with lemony quinoa and shaved fennel?  I don't even like fennel, and this was an AMAZING dish.  (and I ate the fennel). Fresh, tasty, lemony, delicious, perfectly cooked. I'd like some alone time with those scallops.  :-)  I'd order that dish again and again, and again.  It was that good.  \n\nWe had the peach cobbler for dessert. It was fine, a pleasant end to the meal, but nothing exciting.",

As soon as we walked in we glanced to the right and saw the \"bread station\" where they had baskets of homemade breads with thick crusts.  We knew right away that we were in for a treat.  The four course price fixed meal is a no-brainer.  We had fried artichoke, carpaccio and pulpo (octopus).  Everyone was very happy.  Pasta course was excellent, especially enjoyed the Pipette with little bits of eggplant - - amazing flavors.   The fish special (Cobia) was great as was the skate (capers and apricots - - what flavors!).  A few dishes were just a tad over-salted, but not bad.  Espresso's and desserts to die for.  Service?

        "text": "Once-Respected Philadelphia Restaurant takes a Complete 180 with Movie-Themed Dinner\n\n Over the past several years the Marigold Kitchen, set in the quiet neighborhood of Spruce Hill, has been steadily climbing the ranks of Philadelphia's top restaurants. Serving a varied blend of New American cuisine, with a dash of molecular gastronomy, the restaurant has achieved considerable praise from the Philadelphia public and press alike. Therefore, it came highly recommended by our foodie friends, who had eaten there a few months before and were highly impressed with the warm, comforting decor and the seasonally-themed 14-course tasting menu. This is the dinner my wife and I were expecting...\n While it is not entirely unheard of for restaurants to devote their entire concept to a singular theme, even just a single movie, I cannot understand why the owners would dedicate their entire restaurant to a mildly successful summer blockbuster from a few years ago. As my wife and I entered the dimly lit foyer, we were greeted by sounds of sirens and cacophonous gunfire playing loudly over the speakers. It was very dark and we could not see inside the restaurant. Then a loud voice came on over the speakers and announced: \"Welcome to Pacific Rim: The Dinner.\" This was especially confusing for my wife and I, as we had never seen Pacific Rim. A few minutes later our host appeared; a tall man in a red duster, with gold plated loafers and what appeared to be welding goggles. He sounded a little like that actor from Sons of Anarchy, but I'm not sure. Before we could tell him our names he yelled at us: \"Don't you know there's a kaiju coming? Come on, we need to get to my kaiju bunker!\"\n He led us into the main dining room, which was decorated with poorly made paper mache buildings and miniature cars. We were led to our table in the second room, apparently supposed to look like some kind of metal bunker. It was very cold and when we asked our host if he could turn up the heat a bit, he ignored us and left. Several minutes later we were greeted by our server, a young man in a military vest speaking in a noticeably fake Australian accent, who introduced himself as Hercules Hanson. Rather than asking us for our water preference or opening our wine, he sort of sneered to us and said: \"It was hard enough fighting the kaiju before. Now we have to do it while eating dinner!?\" Then he leaned in very close to us and said: \"We're going to need your help.\"\n Before I could ask him what was going on he left and I suppose our dinner started. The food, which seemed to come out completely randomly, wasn't all that bad but there were a few issues. My Stackhouse Pentecost burger was a bit overcooked, while my wife's Kaiju Second Brain Sweetbreads could have used a bit more seasoning. At one point I asked our waiter for some ketchup, and he returned with a small cup full of what he said was some kind of bone powder, which turned out to be just ground black pepper. When I tried to complain about this to my host he yelled at me, telling me that it was one of the rarest substances known to man, which is not true. Later, when I asked my waiter where the bathroom was, he scowled at me and said, \"That's classified information.\" Also several times during the meal a loud red light would flash and my wife and I were forced by the wait staff to run to the dining room, where we handed water guns and made to shoot card board monsters that would pop up from the floor. It was very strange. My wife was very upset. \n Finally when we finished, we were approached by a large intimidating British man who asked us to follow him for our dessert. He led us upstairs to some kind of computer room and directed us to the middle of the room, where we saw two empty rubber robot costumes. When I asked him what we were doing, he replied. \"We're cancelling the apocalypse!\" At this point my wife and I asked for the check and left. I'm just very disappointed by our dinner experience, and confused as to why management would decide to take an expanding restaurant in this direction. My wife and I will probably not be returning, and we still have no plans to watch Pacific Rim.",

        "text": "New Orleans or N'Awlins is known for its Louisiana Creole cuisine, which combines French, West African, Amerindian, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian influences.  The blend of culture screams deliciousness.  How can you go wrong?\n\nSeafood is a staple in this type of cuisine, no doubt due to the proximity to the Mississippi river and the Gulf.  So it was an exciting first taste experience at Deanie's\n\nAt Deanie's, we were welcomed promptly and were seated quickly by a friendly hostess.  After we ordered, the waitress served up a complimentary appetizer of boiled potatoes with butter.  The spicy kick in the red skin of the potatoes was a welcomed surprise to an otherwise plain looking dish.\n \nDeanie's Charbroiled Oysters\nThe first dish that came out was the charbroiled oysters.  They were charbroiled to perfection giving the oysters in a half shell a crunchy surface with gooey Romano cheese beneath and flavours of garlic, butter and spices.  Delicious.  They oysters were better alone than with the French bread... but the bread was useful in sopping up the juices in the pan.\n\nBBQ Shrimp\nThe barbecue shrimp dish was presented nicely with a slice of lemon and a French baguette.  The baguette was superior to the bread that was offered with the oysters as it had a crispier exterior and a warm, fluffy interior - even better for sopping up the New Orleans blend of seasonings in the oily broth that hugged the succulent, jumbo, head-on shrimp.  One of my favourites at Deanie's - just peel and dip!\n\nCrawfish Duo\nNext came the crawfish duo.  The crawfish tails were served two ways, fried and in an étouffée with a side of fries and coleslaw.  The batter of the fried crawfish was not greasy but it was difficult to taste the crawfish.  However, the non-fishy crawfish in the étouffée was sweet and meaty.  Étouffée is a type of stew served over rice.  The word étouffée is French for smother, which describes the process of cooking in a covered pan over low heat with a small amount of liquid.  An étouffée starts with a roux, a base thickening agent that consists of equal portions of fat and flour.  The roux in this étouffée at Deanie's was cooked with onions, peppers, celery and garlic to a brown colour consistency which corresponds to a deeper, richer flavour profile.  It was fantastic!  Though the coleslaw was forgettable as it had too much mayo.\n\nThe service at Deanie's was solid.  The waitress was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  I was never able to get to the bottom of my soda as it was refilled time and time again - another one of those perks that I find is always executed better in the United States than Canada.  God Bless America! :)\n\nDeanie's was a great start to a food tour excursion in New Orleans!",

Initially I felt bad for her- we all have those days- but she continually kept talking about it and never got back on track. My daughters chicken tenders came out without sauce as ordered, I asked for Mayo and they had no Mayo. Our leisurely lunch turned into about 2 hours with most of the time spent waiting. Another server came out and repeatedly apologized seeing what a mess it was and she had just gotten there. We will be back but today was just not our day there. I ultimately brought my entire meal home bc I wanted Mayo on my sandwich and was annoyed and just ready to leave.",

They also give you really good hand massages and really take care of your cuticles. My pedis are pretty great too, even though I hate pedis and live in fear of the cuticle snipper near my toes, they are VERY gentle. I asked not to use the cuticle snipper last time and they didnt and it was fine! Lasted weeks.\n\n- It can be expensive for manis that don't last very long. Even my gel mani peeled after a week without me even picking at it. \n\nWaxing:\n\n+ Great shape, efficient waxing, average price!\n\n-  I hate getting asked if I want my upper lip done, too, and then getting a disapproving look if I say no. Lol, and without fail this ALWAYS happens. Everywhere. But a small thing, and I think it's because the woman who does my waxing seems me pretty regularly and I usually say yes.\n\nHaircut/color:\n\n+Twice I have received AMAZING cuts (like life-altering) and pretty amazing color, here. \n\n-But also, twice I have received subpar cut and colors that I actually got corrected somewhere else. So it really depends on who you get. \n\n\nBottom line:\n\nThe charm of Penn Campus is not having to make an appointment and being made a priority to be seen, but it's risky for haircut and color. Anything else, and you'll get pretty good services. I recommend getting a pedi or a wax for sure, and most guys I've seen have been super happy with their haircuts here.",

        "text": "I fashion myself a \"Lebanese foodie,\" mainly because I grew up eating home-cooked Lebanese food multiple days out of the week. Both of my parents are Lebanese, so this source is not without competence. I have been wanting to dine here for a few years now: my girlfriend and I love Lebanese food, and we have been to Cedars, Alyans, Bitars, Manakeesh, King Tut's, Boutrous', and King Tut's - all multiple times. Unfortunately Hummus is my least favorite of them all.\n\nFirst the good news: the price is great! Middle Eastern food can be very labor-intensive, and consequently very expensive (try picking parsley for an hour to make Tabboule!). Second, the atmosphere is great - smack dab in the middle of University City, it is lively and fun. Unfortunately, the good news ends here.\n\n1. The Tabboule is not good at all. They serve it with WAY too much Burghul (to pronounce this correctly, try saying \"butthole\"  but with a light T and light H). The parsley to Burghul ratio is horrendous. I will add that they should use number 1(fine) Burghul, not larger ones. Also, not enough lemon is used - this seems to be an ever-present problem with Middle Eastern places.  The weirdest issue I have with the Tabboule is the use of cumin! Save it for the kibbeh and other hushwe, not for mezze items!  \n\n2. The Hummus was sort of a bright spot in an otherwise plane of darkness. My only recommendation is to add a bit more garlic and a more liberal amount of lemon. Texture is perfect!\n\n3. What the Kibbeh was that Kibbeh! I've never seen anything like it! The outside did not have any Burghul kneaded with the meat, and the hushwe (filling in the middle) was...what was it? I could not determine if it was me meat or lenten. It should be minced lamb/beef, minced onion, pine nuts, cumin, allspice, salt and pepper. \n\n4. The Syrian Bread was too doughy, and lacked a pocket. I think the problem is the lack of a hotter oven (you need a really hot exposed burner to make the bread separate.\n\n5. The Grape Leaves (\"Wara 'Enub') were mushy, and compact. I prefer them served warmed, with meat in the middle. I like the ricy kid as well-but not prepared like they did here. \n\nAll in allI was disappointed by this place. Pricing and location were great, but the food product was very sub-par :( I did hear that the owners were Israeli, so maybe the Israeli version of Lebanese food is a bit different? Can anyone on here speak to that? If so, then I do not like Israel's take on Lebanese food. If not, then they definitely missed their target!",

        "text": "I contacted Fields Data Recovery regarding a laptop that had failed and used eMMC chip memory instead of a standard hard drive.  They were informed in both email and conversation that the issue was that the power supply on the mother board had failed and the computer used not a hard drive but eMMC chip memory.  The service I requested was a recovery of the files from the eMMC chip.  Fields assured me this was not a problem, that they did this all the time, and that such services start at, and usually cost $199.  They also stated that I would get a list of the files that could be recovered, and there would be no charge if not successful.  \nI shipped the unit to Fields and several days after shipping, contacted them as I had not heard from them.  After two phone conversations I received a call with a message from their engineers asking if we had removed the hard drive prior to shipping.   I explained again that there was no hard drive, it was an eMMC memory chip.\n\nI then got a call from them stating that the unit required a completely different procedure, that it was not at the right office for such a procedure (called a chip off) and that the procedure would cost $960 dollars, the bulk of which was payable in advance, was non refundable, and that there was no guarantee of success.\nThus, I came to the following conclusions\n- The personnel answering the phone had either ignored my statements about the eMMC chip storage or were ignorant as to what it was.  If they were ignorant, then they should have escalated the case to someone who understood.\n- The engineers who worked on my computer ignored the case file notes.\n- The engineers who worked on my computer could not recognize an eMMC storage system (note these are supposed to be top talent computer storage personnel).\nI also received a letter from them that did not accurately represent the issues, but rather said that the drive (again, no drive) needed to be sent to the R&D division, have parts procured and replaced, be put in a clean room, etc. etc. etc. none of which is part of the chip off procedure, or what I had been told on the phone.\nI asked for the laptop to be sent back to me, at which point I was told it would cost $60, and that there was no less expensive option.  This is at odds with their letter to me where they acknowledged that it was a laptop I was sending, and stated specifically that offered a free USPS return option should I not want to go forward.  When I paid the $60 the person who took my money could not tell me when the unit would ship.  When I did get my tracking number I found that it was shipped via UPS ground (despite being told in email that I would receive it that day - overnight) which at full retail cost was $11.04 (I am sure that as a large customer they have a substantial discount).  So it would appear that the rest of the money was a \"fee\" for them looking at the laptop, figuring out that it was what I told them, and telling me it would cost almost a $1000.00.   When we received the laptop back we found it had been packed in a random box, 10 times the size of the laptop, with a single layer of bubble wrap and no other packing so basically the laptop was loose in the box (note, it had been shipped in a padded, packed box made for laptops).  Additionally all the screws that were removed to open the unit had not been replaced.\nI have attempted to complain to Fields about some of these issues but their response has been to ignore my comments and rather attempt to place all blame on me for simply being unhappy with the price.  I am unhappy with the price.  I am more unhappy that I was mislead, that I feel this is bait and switch, that despite being given proper information it was ignored, that the letter to authorize work presented a false list, that I feel I was charged for it being examined, that I was told it was express shipping and it was not, that it was so poorly packed for return and the poor poor level of customer service.\nI would judge the practices of this company to be exceptionally deceptive.  Their strategy is to get the hardware and then convince you of the need to pay them.  And then when you say no and complain, they become hostile and uncooperative.\n\nAVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS.",

If you don't want to go through the hassle of explaining why you are leaving just tell them you are moving out of state.\n\nI have no problems with Sweat Fitness, I loved it there, but I left because of the hours. I work 12-9 everyday and can never make it to the gym before they close. I am getting a membership at Planet Fitness simply because it is open 24 hours and better fits my needs.",

There are four elevators total and this hotel should have at least eight.  The rooms start on the 8th floor and go up from there.  Our room was on the 9th floor.  Every time we had to get to the lobby or up to our room, we had an extensive wait.  We stayed an entire weekend and going downstairs to the lobby on that Saturday was the worst.  We had five packed elevators go by before we decided to take the stairs down.  The stairs were not safe, not well lit, and when traveling with young children, it's not very practical.  My family and another family that was waiting had to take the stairs to the lobby and the stairs lead to the street, not to the lobby of the hotel. I found this to be unacceptable for a supposed 4 star hotel.  It's really a 2 and a half star hotel but you pay for a 4 star price.\n\nThe pool - It looked nice on the photos but on a hot summer day, the pool was packed and not very family friendly.  It's akin to something you would find at a fancy Miami hotel that caters to singles.\n\nThe noise - You can hear the noise from the hallways and you can hear the housekeepers in the morning.\n\nOverall, you are paying for the location of this hotel.  It is chic but the elevators there are a problem. I can only imagine if one goes out of service, how much longer the lines would have been to go up or down at this hotel.  Booking directly with the hotel allowed us to park for free, a very nice perk!",

There was a jacuzzi bath in harahan (that sold out), and the next closest store to have that item (and it was a lower price) was Baton Rouge.... Molding costs different prices.  You make these cost comparison worksheets between lowe's and Home Depot, and you decide one over the other, and knowing a 2x4 was $1.93.  You go to a store somewhere a few miles away and it is $1.95....   You're like what the ????-- but this is true for ANY chain store.  Wal-mart, lowe's, Home Depot, etc.  \"this is how they compensate for shoplifting\". And don't think it's inner-city stores.  A friend of mine at Lowe's told me their decision to prosecute was based on the fact that the man had a credit card with them containing a 10k limit.  None of it used, he'd stolen multiple big ticket items wearing a suit & tie...... Amazing-  so check & compare 2x.  Maybe 3x to be sure and you'll see what I am saying is true....\n\nBtw-when you rent from this store (like I did) they tack on a 10% \"insurance\" -- which is optional, but I didn't ask and it says I didn't sign for.  I used a jackhammer for 1.5 hours, but the minimum they charge is for 4.  Extra hours are $17, so to be fair",

        "text": "I know the rage is having e-books on a Kindle or tablet but for me there is something quite special about owning & using a physical copy of a book.  The crisp smell of a new book, how the pages feel underneath my fingertips & knowing that this is a piece of the past that seems to be slowly fading away along with newspapers.  I can only stare at a computer screen for so long before needing a break but I can spend hours reading from an actual book.  The only way a person can browse through a book & see if it is something they actually want to purchase to continue to read further (& possibly refer to later on as well) is to go to an actual bookstore.  Sure I can get online to read a blurb but it's a blurb that Amazon or the publisher has chosen to share.  I like to flip through the pages/chapters to find a little morsel & if it catches my eye then I'll probably end up buying it.  Even if it doesn't end up being a very good book it can still be useful...everyone needs something propped up now & then & books have been fulfilling that need for a very long time :-)  \n\nThough BAM is very similar to B&N (complete with coffee shop, WiFi & various non-book items) there doesn't seem to be as many choices on the west side to go to.  The employees greet you & ask if you need assistance without being overly attentive.  Today a woman needed help & the man working in the coffee shop was able to help her find the section she was trying to find...that's good cross training of employees!  He then asked if I was finding what I needed & after I replied yes, he went back to the coffee shop to resume his work. Granted it was the middle of the afternoon & it wasn't really very busy but it showed he was paying attention & cared enough to help.  If you're someone who prefers to order your books from online you should try to see if a physical store has the copy first...esp. if you are out & about anyway. No matter how fast ordering from online feels, nothing beats having book in hand if you're paying the same price as you find it online & being able to enjoy it immediately.",

I must say that I LOVE the decor, I would call it rustic, industrial chic.  Lots of refurbished woods, pops of bright orange and dark iron with soft accents.  \n\nTwo of us where there early so we grabbed a drink at the bar.  The bartender was pleasant, accomodating and very knowledgable (he was also pretty cute but thats besides the point)-after we were educated about the drink specials and current  draft selections, we made our drink choice (both different beers) and were very pleased.\n\nWhen we were seated we were greeted by our waitress who gave us the run down of the menu and educated us about ordering.  She too was very knowledgeable about what was being served and where it was sourced (something that is VERY important to my friends and me)\n\nWe ended up getting some apps, a large salad and each tried a different dish so we could share.  Calimari, deviled eggs, and burrata.  All were amazing but the eggs in particular were delish!  It was a sample plate of 3 different kinds of eggs.  Pickled beet deviled eggs, a deviled egg with puffed farro on top and an egg with shaved pork belly.  I am not a huge bacon person but it was mind blowing.  The pork belly was so light and airy it reminded me of confetti...bacon confetti on a freakin deviled egg O.M.G.\n\nFor dinner we all ordered different dishes and shared.  We also ordered the chopped salad with shaved brussel sprouts.  The veggies were crisp and the vinaigrette was the perfect complement to the dish with a balance of savory and tart.  \nFor dinner we each shared the farro rissoto, the rigatoni bolognese, the jersey scallops and steak. I had ordered the steak.  I ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The scallops were delicious and tender but not undercooked.  I really enjoyed the uniqueness of the farro.  It was mixed with roasted root vegetables and topped with some sort of parmesan cheese.  The rigatoni was great as well.  The short ribs were so tender and juicy, everything just melted in your mouth.  The wait staff was accomodating but not over bearing and all in all it was a wonderful experience.\n\nI actually live in the suburbs of Philadelphia but i will surely be back.  I enjoyed my experience so much that I actually gave my brother a gift certificate for the Tavern for Christmas.  \n\nI can not wait to return and see whats on there ever changing menu!  Way to Farm and Fisherman youve done it again!",

        "text": "I am a bit mixed about this one. I can see things that I feel are right on point and others that are off. So, let's just roll on this one.\n\nThe atmosphere? The place is one of the mixture between counter service and sit-down, where you order and pay and then have it brought out to you. Very casual dining with a modern, someone industrial type of feel. They have a small, but interesting menu. We sat at the bar and had drinks while waiting for a to-go order. Talk to the owner and the bartender Randy (formerly from {Pub}licity, where I used to hang out on Thursdays - RIP). The owner used to do BBQ competitions, and it shows with how well the meats are prepared. I felt it was a bit too bright and the owner adjusted the lights down and I hope they continue in that mode. Still bright enough to be casual, but dim enough to fit a night-time mood.\n\nThe food? I tried the plate with everything (The Whole Shebang), so I could get a better sampling. My wife tried the Harlen Nachos. My feel. Brisket is nicely cooked (good bark, with a nice moist center). I feel it could use a bit more seasoning on the outside, but that is a personal preference. The chicken was also well cooked, for which I give them kudos. Chicken is way to easy to oversmoke and end up with a brick. The pulled pork is okay, but a bit boring for me. It is definitely one to add some sauce to. The ribs were well cooked, but I also found them a bit lacking. My favorite was the sausage, which was very tasty. The nachos were the winner of the group, as the way the pulled pork is done it blends nicely into the Mexi-que style (yeah, I just made that style up).\n\nThey also have something ridiculous on the menu called The Cledis, a six pound challenge monstrosity. A pound and a half of fries covered with a pound and a half of white queso, a pound and a half of pulled pork and a pound and a half of smoked chicken. Finish it solo and get your picture on the wall and get a $50 gift card (come out $4 ahead). Finish it soon and be the first one to show how dumb you are eating 6 pounds of food in one sitting? ;-)\n\nService? Everyone was friendly and very attentive. Lower crowd for a Friday, but Bellevue One is still having issues getting all the way up on its feet. Hopefully the hotel will help when it finally opens.\n\nI will be back, as there are additional items that sound very interesting, like the Honey Hot Block appetizer, or the Southern Shine (pulled pork, fried green tomatoes, pimento cheese and candied bacon), Diablo Jones (pulled pork, white queso, jalapenos and Habenero bbq sauce) or Alabama Slammer (chicken, candied bacon and some white sauce) sandwiches. \n\nIn summary. Nice to have a decent BBQ place I am not overly blown away by Murffs and Bar-B-Cutie, while having a very moist and almost buttery pulled pork, falls flat. Plus having a well cooked brisket and great BBQ sausage? Bonus. I will revisit this after getting a chance to try the sandwiches, as I was weighing between average (3) and above average (4).",

        "text": "Okay. I've never heard of this place before so when I walked by it I was interested in their products.  The store itself is really cute; it's almost rustic.  It has a wood cabin kind of feel; natural and earthly just like their products.  I walked around and smelled their body butter and hand butter sticks.  They all have that natural bees wax smell; which smells interesting.  It has a distinct smell and some may like it and others may not.  But they have some body butters that have other natural ingredients to hide the smell of the wax if you are not a fan of it.  I really like the non-scented one but then I found a cinnamon one called Spicy Mandarin and it smells really nice.  I also picked up some of the hand butter and I really like it.  It may take some time to get used to the smell because it's really different from any other cream/butter that I've used; but I find that it really makes my skin soft and on the days my hands are really dry it works well to relieve my problem.  I also found this stick of Breakout Buster that I had to ask the lady about.  I asked her if it really helps with blemishes and she said it does.  Well I wanted to find out for myself.  I'm 27 years old but I still get blemishes and I feel the need to pick at them, which just makes matters worst.  Well I've had these two ugly \"blemishes\" that I've hacked away at; I've been trying to put stuff on it to keep them from drying out or for them to go away.  Well I remembered that I had this Breakout Buster stick so I decided to give it a try.  I put some on last night and believe it or not they're almost gone!  They're on their way to healing and I've only used it once.  The lady who worked in the store said she uses it the moment she feels something coming out or if she notices a read area forming.  You can also use it for cold sores.  \n\nI also decided to ask the lady what I could use for my really dry and rough cheeks.  She suggested washing my face with either goat's milk soap or a pumpkin one that they make.  I've heard that goat's milk works well so I decided to give it a try.  Well I didn't have to buy a whole bar because she gave me a decent sized sample.  She also gave me a sample of face cream to try out.  Well I used both products last night and this morning my rough cheeks are not so rough.  They're not smooth like a baby's bottom, but I'm sure if I keep using the soap and the cream my problem will clear up. \n\nThe great thing about this store is if you are unsatisfied with their products you can just bring it back and they will refund your money.  They are that confident in their products.  They have a section of babies and for men but they carry a lot of stuff targeted for women.  They also have a fast selection of soaps and you can just ask for a sample.  I really want to try out the pumpkin one the next time I go back.\n\nI have to say I'm really excited about this store.  The sales woman was SO nice, extremely friendly and very knowledgeable.  Their stores also do a points system and for every 100 points you safe $5.00.  I bought about $24 with of products and I received about 32 or 34 points.  The woman also gave me a card with a list of chemicals to watch out for when shopping for similar products (soap and creams).  I think I found a new store to be my soap and body butter supplier!  But wait you haven't heard the best part yet!  It's a Canadian company!",

Find Siam Cuisine in a shopping center south of Peddler's Village. It has been there for quite some time. Their interior is clean, intimate, and dimly lit. The decor is unassuming, the white-washed walls adorned with paintings of Thailand. Plants dot the restaurant. A bar takes up a nice part of one wall (they have good in-house drinks here). Music is subtle; sometimes you'll hear Thai or easy-listening tunes.\n\nThe fare is best here, of all the Siam Cuisine locations. Dinners have sometimes been hit-or-miss, but luckily the food has been top-notch the last two times I visited. Their menu is large and contains vegetarian dishes. I've tried many items, including:\n- the appetizer sampler, which has rolls, dumplings and a stick of beef and chicken satay. Not bad!\n- the tom yum soup - get it spicy.\n- the staple phad thai can be served with shrimp, chicken, beef or plain. Bean sprouts and peanuts complement it and I'd squeeze some lime juice to sweeten it up.\n- the duck salad is served with crispy chunks of duck, peppers, and tomatoes and has a sweet tangy sauce on the side. The \"bowl\" is edible too.\n- the seafood curry has bamboo-shoots, scallops, string-beans, peppers, and asparagus. Delicious.\n- the Thai herb cake and toffee tort desserts rock, and I'm not even into dessert.\n\nService is exemplary. Servers remember your name and face and are welcoming, rarely missing a beat even during busy hours. There isn't a long wait for food and water is refilled quickly.\n\nCall and reserve a table if you're more than a few folks.

I pray for the poor souls who have let this deter them from this bijou of an eatery.\n      First off, I will gladly wait in line for exceptional food. So the line out the door does not hinder me whatsoever. I don't view this line as an inconvenience, rather, a 20-30 minute opportunity to get my mind in the zone, and prepared for the epic symphony of flavor that's going to take place in a matter of moments. If for some reason you haven't allotted the proper amount of time and must skip this process of the loading stage, you may do call ahead when you are on the way, enter through the left side of the building, and immediately pick up your food to enjoy elsewhere.(Might I suggest one of the picnic tables at Centennial Park, a mere 2-3 minute drive) BUT... for those of you who have planned ahead, thought this through, and don't mind putting in a little sweat equity waiting in the sun just to get in the building... I'm talking to you now. \n      When you step through the door, consider the cool welcome of the air conditioner a pat on the back for your time well spent out in the heat. In all likeliness there are still going to be 3-4 more patrons in front of you waiting to place their order. Once again, a good thing, a carefully planned out process put in place by the saints who built this place from the bottom up. Take this time to observe the menu mural, think about what you really want out of this meal, as well as your life. Might I suggest the Large White Plate, that's 2 white meat breasts with a wing still intact on each one.  Each plate is served with your choice of 2 sides, with an additional side for a mere .50 cents extra. Before I even get into the tastes of this meal, in all its glory, I feel it should be said this meal is huge, and perfect for sharing. I go with my girlfriend and we are both able to split this and feel great about the decision afterwards, especially after adding another side. It's still alot of food, but you don't feel terrible about yourself and life in general when you walk out. Also we get out of there paying only roughly 14 bucks, plus a couple dollars tip to the hometown heroes on the other side of the counter. Seriously, where else can you go to eat at one of the best places in a city, and only pay that. Good luck my friend.\n       As far as heat levels are concerned I have not branched out that much, because the first time I visited Hattie B's I tried the Medium, and could not possibly imagine it getting any better than that, so I haven't bothered switching it up. I love good spice, but I don't like sweating, sniffling, and/or crying while I eat so I stick with this because its got solid heat, but doesn't make me want to slam my face in a bowl of milk after every bite. For the real spice pansies they also offer a southern style (no heat) and a Mild. And for those who want their meat on the hotter side of Medium they offer a Hot and a Damn Hot. I haven't gotten the beer there yet, but they seemed to have a fair selection of canned beers, and a few drafts if I'm not mistaken. ON TO THE MEAL.\n      You order your food, fix your drink, then go find a spot. Yes, seating is limited. Its not because ample seating is not provided. Its because this is a small restaurant, it's an awesome restaurant, EVERYBODY WANTS THIS RESTAURANT. Chances are you are going to have to sit with somebody else that you don't know... I know.. I know.. for some introverts your initial thought may be \"seriously sit with strangers, OMG OMG panic attack\". But chill out... these are cool people who are here for the same reason you are, to GET DOWN on some world class hot chicken. While you converse with your new friends, sip your sweet tea, your beer, or whatever you may choose to drink, at some point, as you are lost in conversation, an angel is going to appear from heaven and place a basket of food down in front of you.\n     At first glance ahh.. what a beauty. Two chicken breast, fried to perfection, glistening in the sunlight, coated in sauce, served over classic white bread that is now just drenched with that same savory heat. To the right of the basket your eyes are seduced by the Pimento Mac and Cheese, just sitting there, hanging out, daring you to try it first, as if trying to outdo its neighboring side, that redskin potato salad, just staring at you in all its humble glory. Wow, all this, you haven't even tasted it yet. But then...\n     Pick that breast up. No fork required, you are a man (or woman) and this is your chicken. Nobody's watching, its just you. Take that first bite. Everything around you goes black. For one moment in time, there is nothing else. Two things. You. Chicken. You realize you know nothing about chicken. Everything you knew about that winged bird up until this point is a bold faced lie. From here words are useless. To truly know its splendor, one must try their self.",

        "text": "The customer service at this location is a real disappointment. \n\nWe ordered contactless delivery for an order of 2 pizzas and a soda and when the delivery person left the order we discovered the soda had been forgotten.\n\nWe tried to call them but waited a total of more than 10 minutes on hold over the course of 2 calls (we got disconnected the first time having never spoken to anyone).\n\nI then reached out via the contact form for our online order and the manager (Colby?) called us back and left a voicemail saying he could have the delivery driver bring the soda if we wanted and claiming the phone system was having issues but if I wanted to call back they had fixed it.\n\nI returned his call after 25-30 minutes (we did not notice the voicemail right away) and got through. But he told me that the delivery driver had gone home (at 4pm on a Saturday?) and so they would place a credit on my account for the soda and I would get it with my next order. Though I agreed to this, as soon as I got off the phone I realized what a disappointing solution this was.\n\nI ordered something, paid for it, tipped the delivery driver, and did not receive what I paid for. It was disappointing enough to not have the soda to go with the meal but then even the offer that it would be delivered that day was revoked and instead I was left in the position of having to place a future order in order to get something I had already paid for. \n\nThe way the store offered to compensate for their mistake was to force me to order again to get what I paid for? This didn't seem right so I followed up with Dominoes customer care and explained all of the above.\n\nThe paraphrased response I got from Brenda H. was \"We're chronically understaffed so mistakes happen. Sorry about the inconvenience. I have verified that there is a credit on your account for that soda.\"\n\nAfter this disappointing response I figured I would simply ask for my money back and be done with it. When I responded, I told her I was not happy with that solution and would prefer not to loan Dominoes the $2.30 I paid for the soda until the next time I ordered (which was becoming increasingly unlikely based on this experience). I asked that they just refund the cost of the soda to the credit card I used to pay.\n\nBrenda responded back telling me that I would have to call her and give my credit card information over the phone.\n\nYikes!\n\nForgetting the soda was a simple mistake that could have been no big deal. It would have been easily corrected with a refund or even just sending the driver immediately back out when they realized the issue (instead of waiting for me to confirm that I did in fact want the item I ordered for deliver, delivered). \n\nAfter sending the delivery driver home within a window of 30 minutes after offering to send him back out, and then putting me in a position where I had to place a future order to get something I already paid for, it would have been nice if they offered something as an apology. \nAn order of cheese bread? A second soda? Really anything at all that says \"Yeah, we messed this up. Here's something for the inconvenience.\"\n\nBut they did none of this. \nThey messed up the order the first time.\nOffered a solution and then rescinded it.\nSettled on a bad solution.\nAnd then most frustratingly responded badly to my response that I was disappointed by the experience.\n\nIf this is common for Dominoes, I'd encourage them to reevaluate their approach to customer service. This is a great example of what not to do.\n\nI won't be calling them to give my credit card number over the phone. And I guess I'll have to find a new place nearby to order delivery. \n\nIf you're looking to order chain pizza in this area, I encourage you to avoid this location. Maybe try the Papa Johns right around the corner.",

They are priced per piece and I was the only one at table who enjoyed them. The others liked the churros best. \n\nI also convinced the table to get a hot chocolate, which for those unfamiliar of this type of Hot chocolate, it's not the crappy powder stuff you drink in the winter, but rather a bean to cup, thick, decadent sipping drink. One can easily be shared. It's what I consider to be a perfect end to the meal. My husband and I vividly remember being \"wowed\" by this treat way back on our very first visit here. Try it if you've never had it chocolate this traditional ahem \"proper\" way. \n \n\nAll and all, the entire party was very pleased with their meals and time here. I'm pretty sure they would all come again, in fact, I know my parents would. I'm happy to put it back in our minds now that we live on the opposite side of town.  \n  \n\nParking is a cinch over there and it's located not too far from The Electric Factory if you're looking for a quick post concert din.

Very good flavor and spices with tender juicy chicken.\n\nChicken biryani(spicy): Substandard. Honestly, this was the single dish that dropped my review from 3 star to 1 star. The biryani felt more like fried rice. For some reason, there were raw onions and bell peppers added to the biryani. Never seen that in a biryani at any Indian restaurant I have been to. No real taste in the biryani, too many whole spices, not spicy as requested, just a lot of turmeric adding color. Lumps of white rice in the biryani which suggest it was prepared separately and mixed in with meat and spices like fried rice(Biryani is when you cook rice, meat and spices all together).\n\nGarlic naan: Passable. Consistency more like a tandoori roti. But, not bad.\n\nService: Poor. Our dishes were brought out one by one instead of all together which kind of ruined the dining experience. We were sitting waiting for naan for 5 mins after Manchurian balls was brought to the table. Similar delays for other dishes.

While the food was good, it didn't live up to what I had hoped for.\n     I started with the hush puppies. I thought they had a good consistency, savory (but not overly salty) flavor, but were slightly drier than I would have preferred. Just my own personal preference.\n     For my meal, I went all in on the BBQ. I got the sampler with pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket, ribs, the popover, French fries, and the mac & cheese.\n     I'll start with the good. The mac & cheese and popover were very good. The mac had a thick, cheesy sauce and the pasta was cooked to a great consistency. The popover was huge, light, buttery, with a nice, crunchy cheese top.\n     Going with ok, the fries, ribs, and pulled pork. So the fries might be a bit better than average. Out of the meats, the pulled pork was juiciest. The ribs were very dark with a good bark on them. I prefer ribs that have a little pull to them and don't just fall right off the bone (again, preference. I find that they can be overlooked). These had a nice little tear to them.\n     The \"eh\"... Brisket and the chicken. So the chicken didn't have anything wrong with it per se, but it definitely didn't say BBQ at all. Didn't look to be particularly smoked in any way and didn't have much flavor to it. The pieces that appeared to be from white meat were a bit dry. The brisket was a little confusing. While not a lean cut, it seemed drier than a fatty cut should be. Again, not much of a smoky flavor. I appreciate a restaurant that doesn't try to hide mediocre BBQ by pre-saucing, but this BBQ did require sauce because (other than the ribs) it lacked seasoning and a smoky flavor.\n     Overall, the atmosphere of this place was nice, but the BBQ didn't strike me as particularly memorable.",

I preferred the salad which was crisp, refreshing, and smokey. The bf preferred the tart. It had a great buttery crust but I thought the cheese was processed tasting. I mentioned it reminded me of Handi Snacks but upon reflection it was more like the cheese inside of cheese and cracker sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, it tasted ok but it wasn't gourmet or anything and I felt that it didn't compliment the salad it came with.\n\nFor our entrees we had the Dressel Burger with Naturally raised Missouri beef, aged cheddar, onion jam, house pickles, on brioche and Fish and Chips (catch of the day) with homemade chips, house tartar and pickles.\n\nThe bf had the burger and said it was just ok. He didn't even finish the whole thing but ate all his chips and munched on some of mine. I didn't taste the burger because of Lent (so glad it's almost over) so I don't have anything to say about it.\n\nI had the fish and chips but \"Under the Sea\" is not what came to mind with my experience. It was more like under the river. The fish, unsure of what it was as the menu just says catch of the day and I didn't inquire, was very earthy tasting. I am not a fan of bottom feeders and that was all I could think of. Also, the batter was thick and mushy on the inside and greasy on the outside. The chips were ok but nothing to write home about. I don't care for tartar sauce so I can't comment on how good it was but the bf tasted it and didn't care for it. The pickles tasted sweet and sour and were pretty fantastic.\n\nOur waiter was ok but seemed to disappear at times but they were a little busy. He was friendly and got our order correct. So that's a plus.\n\nAll in all we were disappointed and won't hurry back.\n\n(Quotes taken from \"The Little Mermaid\")",

It was her day, so I'm up for whatever... but fresh salad craving to brewery and burger pub, OK...\n\nBackground knowledge a:  I don't do beer.  I have no problem with people that do, but I have yet to find a beer that I enjoy, and I'd rather drink water than down something I don't care and don't want the calories for.  My friends who do enjoy beer love it here, so I'm sure you will, too.\n\nSometimes you should go with what you know.  Blackstone has an excellent burger, I've had it before.  I know it's juicy, messy, savory goodness.  I wanted a burger.  I should've had a burger.  But I wanted to be good today.\n\nCelebrant co-worker seemed intrigued by the artichoke dip, so since it was her last day with us, we ordered the dip.  It was good, a little greasy for my preferences and the peppers were a little prominent for me.  Lots of chips for the allotment of dip.\n\nOne doesn't normally order an app with lunch, I understand, but my party of four did today.  And don't you just hate it when you order an appetizer and like two minutes later your entrees come out?  Yep, you guessed it.  I get why, but a really great server would've prevented that unless we specifically asked for speed, which we did not.\n\nI selected the Cobb Salad today, and it was good - but not great.  The smoked turkey was sliced for sandwich meat and draped on top, a little disappointing, and the blue cheese crumbles were really crumbles.  The dressing was more Italian than ranch based, and they referred to that as a traditional Cobb dressing?  I guess I've had Cobb salads with non-traditional dressings every other time?\n\nThe rest of my table had a pizza, mushroom sandwich, and shepherd's pie, all with good ratings.  I will also say that at high noon on a Friday there were no parking issues and not too crowded.  You could easily hold a conversation and be understood, which is not always possible in a West End Avenue location restaurant.\n\nWill I return?  Of course, I have a meeting there Monday at 5 PM in fact.  Will I learn my lesson and order something greasy, bad for me pub style food that trip?  Yep, I guess I'll have to go work out now to prepare.",

We ordered the \"Bangkok Street Noodle\" and \"Long Tail Boat Noodle\". The street noodle was pho noodles in spicy and sour soup with bbq pork, minced pork, and fish balls on top. My favorite part of this dish was their bbq pork, because it was very tender. The boat noodle was pho noodles in dark colored soup (couldn't tell what the soup was made of...) with beef and beef meatballs on top. I was not impressed by the boat noodle, and I would recommend that you try other things on their menu.",

There's a good sized cocktail menu, allowing diners to find something they like.  \n\nThe good:  cocktail menu, excellent atmosphere, and most of our food was delicious.  Beet salad was fresh and very flavorful, and my short rib was probably one of the best dishes I've ever had.  Pasta was cooked perfectly, and the short rib literally melted in my mouth.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  We also got a side of mushrooms which was placed on a crostini.  Very delicate but refined.  Two thumbs up.  \n\nThe mediocre:  my wife got the gnocchi - the gnocchi itself was tender and light, but the sauce was forgettable.  Both of us agreed, we would not order this again.  \n\nThe aggravating:  our service was impeccable, and our server was very polite and quite helpful with suggestions, but we had one big gripe.  Several times through out the meal we had our plates cleared, however, we were not asked if we wanted the plates taken away.  We still had some of our salad left, and we had to ask for new small plates when we got our mushroom side so we would have something to put it on (along with the complimentary bread).  I get wanting to minimize clutter, and did not the get the feeling anyone was trying to rush us, but it seemed like everyone was a bit too eager.  Hopefully this will correct itself.  \n\nOverall, the good easily outweighed the last note, so we will likely be back to try more of the menu.",

Finally I decided to get it done, and after trying to find a \"Queer Friendly\" barber shop or salon and falling short, I decided to go with Notch. They were close, they seemed cool as hell, and super cheap prices. \n\nI saw Tori did dope fades so I went ahead and booked with her online for a men's cut. \n\nMy issues with the salon itself start the day before my appointment. \n\nI got a call from them where they confirmed my name, asked if I meant to put down Women's haircut. I said no, I wanted a men's cut. They asked if it was for someone else.... again I said no. I was then told that Tori \"wasn't comfortable\" with that and if I could be switched to Alayna. \n\nMiffed but desperate for a haircut, I said yes. \n\nI ruminated of why this chick would be uncomfortable with cutting my hair and decided maybe she only likes to work on men. Pretty transphobic but okay \n\nWhen I was at the shop, however, I saw her trimming a lady with long hair. This leads me to the conclusion that she's transphobic or homophobic. Maybe both. \n\nThe icing on the cake comes when after I got my cut, I scheduled a touch up in 4 weeks and then left. When I checked my email to confirm my appointment they had me down for..... wait for it.......\n\nA woman's haircut. \n\nSO \n\nQueers Beware. Don't book with Tori.

Biggest complaint is that items are pricy--- items that are available in other stores in the area tend to be 10-30% more here.\n\nGood:\n- Some good local food you'll have a hard time locating elsewhere in the valley.\n- Good selection of packaged goods (both food and non-food items)\n- Some great tasting treats in the deli area\n\nBad:\n- Price. Pricey even for a co-op. If you can buy the item at a different local store, do it... use the co-op for items you can't find elsewhere\n- Price labeled on shelf doesn't match what they charge at the counter always. If this was something that happened once or twice I wouldn't say something, but I've noticed on a number of visits that the price that comes up on the register doesn't match what it says on the shelf. I'm sure if I brought it to their attention, they would give me the lower listed price, but I'd rather not have to do that. It makes me uncomfortable and I hate holding up other customers.\n- Store selection focuses more on home goods (soaps, lotions, oils) and less on produce, and meat. I'd like to see a bigger selection of the latter, and less of the former myself.\n\nOverall, worth a visit. Plan out your shopping, and have this be the \"I can't get this item anywhere else and I need it\" stop, and you'll be a happy shopper!",

What makes this place special is they appreciate your business and go out of their way to make you feel special!  They want to get to know their customers!  It has only been open for a week or so and it had a nice crowd on a Saturday night.  The restaurant is cozy, trendy and nicely decorated with linen table cloths.  It even has small private rooms for a small party and also a sushi bar.  You forget you are in a small strip mall.  The 4 of us all tried different dishes. I started with the miso soup ($5)...I always judge a good Japanese restaurant by the miso soup and this was delicious! The right temperature too!  My main dish was the Sushi/sashimi combo ($25.) and the fish was succulent, fresh and melted in my mouth like good sushi should be.  It was quality!  There were 4 of us and we tried each others dishes.  The calamari salad ($13) was fresh as could be with a light batter on the calamari.  The best appetizer was the Rock Shrimp Tempura ($12) sweet and spicy and wow...delish! The salmon Teriyaki was excellent! ($18)...it came with fresh veggies an they were done perfectly! The filet Mignon steak ($28) was cooked exactly the way it was asked for!  Nice flavor and generous portion.  The chicken teriyaki looked like a generous portion ($16)...even had left overs to take home on that dish.  Service was over the top great!  This tends to be a bit pricey and miso soup or salad is not included in the traditional combo meals, but it is more upscale than most Japanese restaurants and the quality shows! I almost forgot to mention, the chopsticks are not the wooden ones that splinter...they are translucent and quite cool!  In fact all of the dishes are trendy and make a nice presentation! Don't forget to BYOB!  They will even supply a nice wine bucket for keeping it cold.  We were informed the menu will have even more to choose from in July or August.  I look forward to trying the Pad Thai as that will be on their new menu!  Anyway... Does it get any better?  Good service...good food and a bottle of red!!!",

It's new so obviously a lot of people here even when you wouldn't expect but it's legitimately huge and you will never have issues finding a table to chill at, a bar spot to order drinks, or a game to play! No cover when I went on Sunday evening but they do card at the door, at least while I was there. There's outdoor seating as well if you just want to hang out and there are tables between all the games for setting down drinks. The place is 2 floors with games and a bar on each floor. \n\nMenu: special cocktails, mocktails, and classic liquor based drinks - I recommend the The Starman! My favorite so far! No food but you can bring in snacks from other places! The bartenders are friendly and helpful as well when asked to recommend drinks. Prices seemed to be within $8-10 for cocktails which is pretty typical of this kind of place \n\nGames: free to play except pinball. But there is plenty of range and variation so there's something for everybody even if you aren't a big gaming person or good at arcade games (I am not!) - some games are out of order but they have visible signage and I still didn't think we ran out of things to do for a couple hours. The best part - SKEE BALL for days. If there's any issues with the games the staff is also very amiable and willing to help. \n\nSpecial mention for the decor both in the indoor area and the restrooms which are movie themed and brightly light. Hand washing area is up front and shared between the male and female restrooms which is a cool way to ensure everyone washes their hands!\n\nThis is a great new addition to the area and I am excited to come back here very soon",

I called Angelo's on the way to pick up my daughter from daycare to tell them that the fries were missing. They said that I could pick up the fries in 10 minutes.

I go back inside and still more confusion. It's super busy because it's 5pm now (this all began before 4pm for me). No apologies this time and I'm informed that I never paid for the fries. I finally got my fries 15 minutes after that and after I asked where they were 2 more times. My God...seriously??? If I didn't have an upset 5 year old, I would have called it quits an hour before.

The barnacles (fried pickles) were great, better than the average place, and I'm a sucker for a fried pickle. They really could have used a better dipping sauce. I think they served Kraft ranch dressing... a nice Dijon honey mustard or a house made Sriracha aioli would have been a better move.\nMy buddy ordered mozzarella sticks, again, terrible marinara sauce. This is why I don't really order mozzarella sticks unless I'm in an Italian place. But when you're with people... you flow with he crowd.\nI had coconut shrimp at the recommendation of our server. She would have been spot on, had they cooked the shrimp right. A little too over done, and anyone who eats shrimp knows. Overdone shrimp = rubber! But the flavor was good. Maybe you could have also thinned our the marmalade, it was thick, like it was right from the jar.\nOverall, if I want a great drink, with an awesome view and listen to some good tunes... this is the spot! \nMaybe I'll go back tonight for a drink and some wings.",

I couldn't have been happier with that decision.\n\nMy French Dip really hit the spot and was served with crisp, thick steak fries.

The staff was helpful, attentive, and even provided us with good information about the history of Katz's (it opened 2 years ago but the family owned two delis downtown, the first of which opened in 1948). Our waitress, who knew this was our first trip to the deli, said that she hopes we return soon.

Frustrating that they don't advertise these items as they were all great.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Jalapeno Baja chicken sandwich - fresh jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, red onion on a chipotle bun.  It was great.  The chicken was pounded out thin so it had a nice char on it while still being very juicy.  I ordered the fried pickles as a side order as well as the fried jalapenos.  Both side orders were very good.  The pickles still had a nice bite to them despite being fried.  My wife had the smash fries as a side order as well.  They were just ok.  Not sure I would order them again.  They are regular shoe string fries with italian olive oil, rosemary, and garlic.  I only tasted a faint trace of rosemary.  Good but not great.  \n\nThere are tons of options there - they have about 10 different menu options but they have tons of toppings that can be mixed/matched for a create your own burger.

Also, she gave us or check before One person in my group could ask for a sprite to wash the Thai tea down.. Being a waitress, you need to make your customers feel welcomed, not give the vibe of being pushed out the door..but the food makes up for it all. \nService definitely needs to change. \n\n\nFOOD;\n-Edamame; simple and a nice light appetizer. You can't mess up edamame.\n\n-Pork Shumai- came with 4 . my group seemed to love it.. Shoving it in their mouths while still piping hot!\n\n-Shrimp Shumai- also came with 4, was super flavorful with or without the dipping sauce! \n\n-Drunken noodles - was flavorful&& had the prefect hint of heat. If you like medium heat.. This entree is really good! Enough to share between 2 peeps.\n\n-Chicken pad thai - my hubbub gets this every time we go to Equator & it'll he will never pick anything else.\n\n-VEGGIE pad thai with tofu- delish! A tad on the sweet side, but can easily be saved with a little or a lot of sriracha.! \n\n-Basil Shrimp,  sounds tasty, but was super land.. Lacked in flavor and spices. The shrimp were a nice size. I don't recommend this dish.\n\n-Mango w/ sweet coconut sticky rice- a must try if you haven't tried it yet. Definitely will probably only crave it once in a blue moon.\n\n-Fried bananas w/ vanilla ice cream- my group of 3 killed it. R.I.P to the banana.\n-Thai tea- also a must try if you haven't yet.. Also get a glass of water..the sweetness tends to make you thirsty after.\n\nThe menu is SUPER extensive, a tad over whelming, but nothing too crazy. They also offer one whole page of vegetarian in their menu booklet. So that was pretty refreshing for me. I also took pictures of all the pages in the menu booklet for my fellow yelpers!

While the food was great, as always, the service was so unlike our usual experiences that, after experiencing it twice in a row, I thought I should write a review. \n\nThe first of these unfortunate instances began with an unusually long wait for our waitress to even come to the table. Once she did, my husband asked if they had any wheat beers on tap. (There is a note on the beer menu advising to ask the staff about additional beers being offered.) She said if it wasn't on the menu, they wouldn't have it. We pointed out the note on the menu, and asked her to check. She disappeared for 15 minutes, then returned with no answer. Not wanting to wait any longer my husband asked her to describe one of the beers that was on the menu. She said she didn't really know anything about beer, because she didn't drink beer. (!!!) He ordered a different beer, not wanting to wait. I ordered my beverage, and began to order our food, since we knew what we wanted, but she turned away and went to another table. We eventually received our beverages and were able to order our food, but then she visited three other tables, basically chatting, before she went in to enter our order. After we ate we had to practically tackle her to get the check. What should have been a relaxing afternoon in the sun turned out to be a frustrating late lunch.\n\nThe second experience almost didn't happen, as my husband had put our name in for an outdoor table on 18th street and was told it would be about 30 minutes. After 45 minutes with no notice, he went to talk to the hostess. As he arrived at her station another couple walked in and asked if there were any tables available outside on 18th street and they were seated immediately. Then, when the hostess checked the waiting list we were told we weren't on it. We were given some excuse about the changing over from brunch to lunch or something like that, and we had to wait until the next table was ready. When we were seated, the table was set, but there was quite a bit of dried food (egg yolk and other things) on the table; obviously it had not been cleaned properly. We flagged someone down and asked if it could be cleaned, and the look we were given by the staff member made us feel as if we were being too picky. \n\nThe food on both occasions was quite good, as usual, but we left feeling that perhaps the Starr Restaurant Group has grown more quickly than they can handle. Next time we will try a burger at Rouge, instead.",

Without repeating every dish like some other Yelp reviews, the highlights included a dreamy, pillow-like spinach gnocchi, a crisp soft-shelled crab, a perfectly spiced goat medallion, and a savory fiddlehead/pork ragu tagliatelle.  Wow!  The wine pairings were well-conceived and matched the dishes, and everything was explained by knowledgeable, friendly servers.  My advice, if you love food: get here FAST!",

        "text": "I wanted to like this restaurant.  I really did.  Jazzy's BBQ has everything that you would want in a local restaurant.  There is a good story (former local football great opens a restaurant after retirement), it has that dive feel (almost a must IMHO for all good local places), and who doesn't love barbequed meat?  How could having all of these great traits present and accounted for at Jazzy's restaurant go wrong?  Unfortunately, the some of the parts did not equal to the whole in creating the best barbeque experience for me.\n\nAtmosphere - dive feel, lively, friendly, many locals, and busy.\n\nService - Friendly, not as thorough as hoped (forgot an item I ordered), fairly quick\n\nFood - Based on some of the pictures from Yelp and quite a few positive reviews I was anticipating excellent barbecue.  What I received was so-so in taste and quality that it left me a little more than disappointed.  Being from NC, I may be a little biased in my choice for favorite style of barbeque.  This falls mostly with the type of sauce used on the BBQ.  On my visit to Jazzy's I ordered the Pork dinner, which consisted of diced pork, a choice of two sides, and a dinner roll or cornbread.  I ordered the greens (Collard Greens) and the Macaroni & Cheese for my sides.  Not being able to decide between the two, I opted for the dinner roll and paid extra for a cornbread muffin (at least that is what I thought I did).  The Pork itself was decent.  It was diced in chunks (while I am used to pulled or minced, this was okay), which included several burnt or smoky pieces in the mix, which I assume was to heighten the smoky flavor of the meat.  The pork came pre-dressed in a BBQ sauce that had glossiness to it as though it may have been thickened with cornstarch.  Visually the sauce lost me, as I'm not a big fan of glossy gravy like sauces.  To top off my disappointment in the BBQ sauce was that it didn't have much flavor or zing...it was just there on the meat.  The greens were okay, but a little bland to me.  The macaroni & cheese had a shine too.  It was waxy in texture and needed a little salt.  The dinner roll...I never received and the one corn muffin that I did have in my container was overly dry so much so that I did not finish it.         \n \nOverall - So, did Jazzy's get me all jazzed on their BBQ?  Unfortunately, it did not.  Like I stated at the beginning I wanted to like it...but in the end it did not add up.",

Once inside, there was another huge line. You basically take a menu, figure out what you want, and by the time you get to the register, you better know what you want.\n\nThis place is incredibly crowded and cramped, and it seemed very overstaffed to me. Way too many employees walking around, standing around talking, being rude if you were in their way.\n\nSo, for lunch, I had a Debris Po'Boy. I thought it was amazing. Really good roast beef pieces soaked in gravy. Probably one of the best meals I had in New Orleans. \n\nThe day we came for breakfast, there was no line outside, but there was a small one inside. I was standing in front of a counter, reading a menu, and one of the ladies working there yelled at me and told me I couldn't stand there and read the menu, I needed to move. \n\nFor breakfast I had an egg white, turkey omelet. It had no flavor at all. And the turkey tasted old. It was served with biscuits, butter and jam. Those were good. I barely ate the omelet though.\n\nIf I ever visit New Orleans again, I would go get a Debris Po'Boy, but I wouldn't go when it's busy and stand in a crazy line, and I wouldn't go back for breakfast.",

        "text": "The greatest assets of this place are the ambience and the accessible and romantic location. Positively charming interior. I arrived for the night's first seating, so there is no room for excuses for the kitchen or service. The drinks were weak and consistently sweet, sickly sweet. An old fashioned required an extra shot of bourbon to balance. The specialty black cherry martini, garnished with a maraschino cherry (why??), tasted like maraschino cherry juice and required a healthy extra squeeze of lime to balance. Service was pleasant and attentive but didn't seem particularly well prepared to advocate for the menu. The bread/butter service could use an upgrade. On to the food...\n\n* Crabmeat salad - I uploaded a picture which pretty clearly demonstrates my complaint. It clearly shows a fairly generous amount of jumbo lump crabmeat on a dense pile of arugula, neither of which are seasoned in any manner. 3 large grapefruit segments and maybe a sliver or two of fennel somewhere. A tarragon vinaigrette on the bottom of the plate only, and with no flavor of tarragon. The fried shallots were good. No cohesion of flavors whatsoever. The large quantity of arugula plated dry was unforgivable. The crabmeat likewise did not see a drop of vinaigrette, nor a speck of salt or pepper. The fennel was imperceptible. The gross inattention to detail... serving an untossed, unseasoned salad should be offensive to any Frenchman. If you expect me to toss my own, serve the salad in a bowl. An insult to the arugula and the crabmeat alike.\n\n* Hanger steak with fries - I ordered this largely due to the many positive reviews. I'm sorry to say I was largely underwhelmed. The meat was cooked to temperature appropriately, though I highly recommend you order it rare. I didn't and I regret it. The sauce was insipid and devoid of flavor. Almost a head's worth of broccoli on the plate was a bit much, steamed and again completely unseasoned. Cooking food without salt and expecting it to be salted at the table results in bland food which is simultaneously salty. Hanger steak is one of the finest cuts that can be had. This was the most forgettable hanger steak I've ever had. Not bad, but extremely forgettable. The fries were a home run.\n\n*Crepe Suzette - This is a crepe with sauce of orange zest and Grand Marnier, usually flambeed in the kitchen or at tableside to cook off the alcohol.  Take a look at the picture. Do you see even a drop of sauce on the plate? Nope. The crepe was likewise dry and had clearly not been introduced to any sauce in any manner. Powdered sugar, with a bit of stiff whipped cream (on its way to becoming butter) and icy vanilla bean ice cream were left to garnish. A Crepe Suzette served dry. Incorrect and unforgivable. What's with the insistence of serving everything so dry?? I understand the chef recently left to open his own establishment. Perhaps the dishwasher got the promotion.\n\nI was very disappointed as my dinner guests insisted their previous visits were far superior to this experience. I'm not sure this place with amateurish kitchen and bar deserves a repeat visit however. If you're in the mood for casual traditional French, why would you not go to Crepe Nanou? So similar yet better in every gastronomic regard.",

Again, so good and perfectly light too.  For our main course we had Wagyu beef filet and the progression of strip. Both of these were cooked perfectly and rank in our top 5 steaks eaten. For the sauce you must try their house made Worcestershire sauce. The chef worked on the recipe for 10 years to perfect. It's a little sweeter than the regular bottled kind but it's on a whole new level in comparison.  Again have to try it. For a side we did the cream corn brûlée with jalepeno. Just yummy goodness that paired great with everything else. The service was ridiculously good. They had multiple people helping just the two of us and genuinely wanted everything to be perfect for us. They definitely make you feel special for just a normal night out, in a good way!

Contrary to most of the reviews here, I found the hash browns to have way too much of a butter flavor, although they did have a decent crisp. On my way to the bathroom I saw that this flavor was likely produced from the ButterIt, liquid butter alternative container I saw on the shelf. While this is significantly cheaper for the restaurant, I personally think there's a big difference in flavor between this and real butter. The omelette was good -- drizzled in chili and beans and cheese. Nothing special but solid. The one scoop chocolate shake was just okay. I expected a creamy milkshake, but be aware that it seems to be ice cream and ice crushed together so it'll be a icy to sip on. I tried my friend's coleslaw and it wasn't acidic enough and had a little too much liquid. It's really not bad, it's just the standout place I hear hyped about either.\n\nRESTROOMS: Another reviewer commented that the walk there smelled like sewage -- I totally disagree. It was clean and organized, all cans and containers well labeled and put away. \n\nSERVICE: Good, they take care of you at the counter! You'll take the order paper the servers marks up for you and pay at the register in the front. You can tip at the register or leave cash at the counter.",

I could have gone my whole life without knowing about this burger...I forget the name, (it's like the Lucky burger or something) but you'll know it when you see it on the menu: beef patty, pork belly (yes, I said \"pork belly\", not \"bacon\" - there is a big difference), cheddar cheese and tomato jam.

Luckily we didn't have to have a reservation to partake in their patio seating! \n\nI ordered the Chicharron Scramble* because I'm at a point in my life where I require some sort of pork (sorry pig lovers) with my breakfast and my buddy ordered the \"Chick Syl-vain\" Sandwich*. Loved the texture of the sweet potato chips on top of the bountiful serving of eggs, piggy bits, and veggies. The dish was filling without causing a food coma which would be counter-intuitive to our day's plan. The chicken sandwich reminded me of how they do it in Nashville with a thick crispy skin but instead of white bread it was hugged between two fluffy buns in a nest of fries. We also went big on a bottle of bubbly rosé. Our waitress, who I wish I could recall her name, was excellent. There when we needed her and never let our bubbles run dry. Her arm would appear in the corner of my eye, pouring the bottle.

So what better thing to do than run 13.1 miles through the city?\n\nLet's get a couple of particulars out of the way. The Rock n Roll marathons are more expensive than most. They're generally well organized. They're generally a good time. And this one was no exception.\n\nMy wife and I arrived at the start line with dreams of a personal best. After all, it's New Orleans, where speed bumps count as hills. The starting area was expansive, and we were able find the gear check trucks with ease. After an obligatory pre-race photo we went to our separate corals to see what we'd be able to do.\n\nNational anthem, jitters and then bang - we're off. It's up Poydras, a couple of misc side streets, and then settle in for a long run on St. Charles. This offered up a great view of the city and really show off its flavor. There were bands and water-stations a plenty. The only part I didn't like about St. Charles was the turn around. Not for nothing, but using the tracks as the separating distance for the U-turn is a bit tight. Would loved to have seen them loop around a block so you're not breaking stride.\n\nIn any event, back down St. Charles, through another few misc blocks, and then a mile on Peters before turning left to go up Esplanade. I will admit that as we passed Café Du Monde I was very tempted to stop and grab an order of beignets. While I again loved the atmosphere of the city, the bands through this area seemed to be few and far between. Maybe I was just tired, but the two people I ran with felt the same way. In addition, the road got rather rough before heading into the park - can't fault the folks at Competitor for that. :-)\n\nThe finish area in the park was fantastic. Huge area to spread out, great area to meet back up with friends, and a perfect venue for the post-race concert. Every race should be so lucky to have a venue like this.\n\nI rather enjoyed this race. Not quite love, but pretty darn close.\n\nAs for my race itself, I finished with a 1:47:45. Missed a PR by 2 minutes. That said, you couldn't smack the smile off my face at the finish line as it was a rather unexpected time.",

I have to say it was the best burger I'd had in memory, definitely for the previous 10-15 years. I'm no burger connoisseur; I've had my share of fast food burgers now and then (don't care for them); I've attempted to eat 5 Guys' burgers one and a half time (more grease than burger); I've ordered burgers from various chains \"known\" for their burgers like Red Robin; and I've ordered burgers from \"celebrity chef\" burger joints like Emeril's Burgers And More (BAM... natch) and some Gordon Ramsay burger joint, etc., but a burger is by no means something I often crave, and very rarely when I go out. \n\nBut c'mon, this is a locally owned burger joint. How could I not try a burger?\n\nAgain - best burger I'd had in recent memory, totally destroying by far all of the places mentioned above. For maybe $6 this burger blew the $23 burgers I'd had at the \"celebrity chef\" places completely out of the water. Nicely grilled bun, very little grease (but not at all dry), flavorful, no strange bitter or sweet preservative tastes... My ONLY complaint was that it could have used a bit of salt, but I'm a bit of a halophile, so I blame myself.\n\nI've also sampled a number of their homemade soups - by far the best I've tried is their saffron infused chicken corn chowder, but their lobster bisque is fantastic (though it's not really a bisque in the classic french sense; more of a lighter chowder texture), as are the other several soups I've tried.\n\nI've noticed a bunch of reviews here complaining of dryness issues with the homemade cupcakes here. Granted, I've only ever had one, and it had a lovely filling in the center (it was a red velvet cupcake), but it was amazing. No complaints.\n\nIn visits since, sometimes I did get a bit more grease than I'd have wanted, but definitely one of those times was my own fault as I ordered fried onions as a topping and obviously short-ordered fried onions on a flat top are going to be greasy.\n\nBut overall, this is the best burger I've had in all of PA and NJ. The three coworkers that came with me the first time agreed. This place is tremendous, and I try to support it as often as I can; losing it would be a tragedy.\n\nAs other reviews have mentioned, there are very few tables available - I tend to just phone in an order for pickup and enjoy it wherever.\n\nThe staff are very nice and personable, and make a real effort to do everything they can to help you.",

This is the greatest asset they have. It's much like other Hibachi chains but it's very clean and well kept.\n\nService: Well as many of you know, at and all you can eat establishment you tend to have limited need for a server. For the most part they just take your drink order and clear your dirty dishes. This is because it's mostly self serve outside of drinks (because you pay for the drinks separately, they are not included into the pay one price all you can eat few). With this said the customer service was good, the sever did her job, she was delayed once by an annoying customer that kept talking to her like she didn't know English. He kept yabbering on like \"you go school?\" \"you like America, America very good\". Then again what can you expect from a guy wearing smiley face pajama pants in a dining establishment. Maybe I'm being too hard on him, it's possible he was just hit in the head too hard as a small child. Anyway she handled him well and the greeter and cashier were very nice as well. \n\nBy now you may be wondering why the 2 star rating. Well as much as the employees were very nice and the atmosphere was very good, the food left so much to be desired I couldn't live with myself if I gave this place more than 2 stars. After all, when you go to an all you can eat grill, they highest weighted area should be the food. \n\nThe selection was subpar compared to many similar places I've been, but they did have most of the standards. The real trouble is in the fact the food was so poorly prepared and not at all fresh.\n\nMost of the food was dried out and obviously had been sitting there most of the day. I understand that it was probably not busy that day, but I shouldn't have to suffer for their lack of business on a given day. Maybe I'd feel differently if they put a 50% off sign up at the door with a note that said \"stale dried out food after 7pm\".\n\nIn addition to be several hours old and dried out, there were other issues with the food that would deter me from returning. One, the fried rice was very greasy, to the point that I couldn't get past eating more than two spoonfuls, and I'm a big fan of fried rice. The clams were mostly all shells. When I put 10 baby clams on my plate, I was surprised to only find meat in 4 of them. Then I switched to the full sized clams and I found meat in 3 out of 5, better odds on the large ones but I also skipped over several obviously empty shells I saw in the serving pan. So sad, such a waste. All in all I out of about 10 things I tried the only things that were good was the seafood delight and Cajun seafood. The Cajun seafood was dry but still tasty. \n\nPricing: $12.50 a person plus $1.50 for a generously sized soda. With a yelp check in you get 15% off your entires table bill so that makes it more cost effective. The price is very good but, you get what you pay for.\n\nAll in all I don't see myself going back unless It was the only thing available (they are open on holidays including Christmas and New Years). \n\nIll be watching other yelpers reviews hoping it gets better because it would be great to have a good all you can eat hibachi grill nearby.",

I disapprove when it comes to the sushi.  Order the sashimi if you can.\n2. If you aren't going for fish, order the chicken bowl. Go with NO RICE more veggies(veggies after 2PM are usually leftovers tho but chicken is always fresh)\n3. Don't visit the restaurant after 2PM because most of the food left has been sitting around for hours.\n4. Extra sauce? Extra sauce on the side? Order at your own risk. Easily 1000mg+ sodium in 1 bowl.  Suggested daily sodium intake is only 2000mg so 1 meal would take up half or more.\n5.  The teriyaki sauce is high in sodium but it has been cooked.  On the other hand, the soy sauce they have in the jars, happens to be very dirty. They fill the jars with a dirty container that is never washed and they wipe the spouts of the jar with a dirty grease rag.  \n\nI've worked at the oliver square location for 2 months in the past.  I chose to leave because the workers in the kitchen were extremely offensive. TE would lose large portion of their customer base If only the customers could understand the racist and slanderous remarks that the employees would spew.",

        "text": "Sunday afternoon for lunch. Ambiance was nice, dark wood, bar area open and airy with large windows and big-screen TVs for sports fans, etc. The main dining area is your typical grid lay-out with a large buffet area deep in the area, serving Sunday brunch. Appeared very clean and well-organized and decorated. \n\nHostess: Typical 20-something with long hair and an unnatural habit of saying \"like\" entirely too much and a nervous tic of stroking her hair while she talks without making eye contact. Quickly delegated our seating accommodations to some poor co-worker who happened to walk up to the front counter at the time we were ready to be seated. \n\nServer: Nice enough. Really (I mean really) pushed the brunch buffet. ( I wonder why? I guess it's the most common/popular Sunday afternoon choice?) Took a while to obtain actual menus but not an intolerable amount of time. Interesting that, even though this was our first trip here, he never emphasized any other popular menu items aside from the brunch buffet. He did give valuable feedback when I asked about items.  \n\nOrdered: The Overlake sandwich and the BLT-avocado sandwich. (I had the Overlake. Partner had the BLT-A, he wound up wearing most of the A. Messy sandwich.)  My order had a good presentation, tasted great. No complaints really. (I mean who can complain with something when it's smothered in bacon?) I'd probably order it again. \n\nI would like to go again to order from the dinner menu and check that out. It's a fairly new establishment in this chain, so it's decor is current and appealing. The hostess was okay. The server was good, not great. The food was good. No deal-breakers here, but no real reasons for me to activate the culinary phone-tree and recommend it to everyone. It's a good option to occasionally break up the monotony of eateries in the Cool Springs area.",

She listened to my body & was able to work out some kinks that I had not even mentioned. It was my 1st volcanic stone massage & it was magnificent. I will recommend her to anyone with a listening ear. \n\nLocation: On Canal & Carrollton avenue, this is a prime location. Easily accessible. Easily located. \n\nDecor & Ambiance: Was quite elegant & serene. Gave you a real earthy feeling. Welcoming. Inviting. Definite characteristic of a spa.  \n\nOnline booking: This is by far the best thing since sliced bread & I hope others follow suit. It makes the process all the easier. \n\n\nThe bad: \nNoise level: To say this is a spa, a place of relaxation, it was waaaaayyyyy too noisy inside. When I entered & we turned the corner to the changing area, all I could hear was cackling. I understand a little chatter, but it seemed as though I was on a school yard at recess time. Inside voices weren't being used here.  \n\nSpace: OMG!!!!! can you say small? I mean smaller than small. The common area was jammed pack with ladies. There's an overflow of sorts, maybe people don't know it's there, but my goodness, it needs to be utilized. I normally sit a spell after my massage, but this was not an option on this occasion as the common area was very congested. 3 toilets in the ladies area, 3, three, trois, tres, trio of toilets; that's a nooo nooo nooo. \n\nLimited parking: I get it, it's Canal & Carrollton & it's only street parking. No biggie, but maybe a better location would be the call of the day. \n\nSo I will go back, I have more kinks for Renata to work out, but it'll be during the daytime, when the other ladies are at work; then there will be moooooore space & less people.",

Always assistance there to help if you need to compare Jackets/Helmets/Etc.  Staff seems to be fairly knowledgeable. Note: Harley Screaming Eagle tuners will NOT be likely to be accepted at any other shops (Found none in Reno which will use the Screaming Eagle Tuner).\n\nTraining:\nVery willing to set you up with a class, but they lack in rescheduling, retaking course portions, etc.  Did not give hints and tips to my girlfriend to help her prepare for the class (i.e. Do grip exercises, illustrating glove types and importance of fit, etc.).  I normally rave about the class for first time riders (I took the course in Las Cruces and benefitted greatly even though I've ridden most of my life), but with these snafu's I'm not certain I will continue recommending them.  The training quality is still above par from what I've heard from my friends that I've sent to the course.  Overall, Good Training during the course, Bad preparation and course scheduling.\n\nService:\nI would ONLY recommend allowing the service department to do minor maintenance or Harley branded installations.  I had a multitude of parts I had installed and I had to go into the shop and show the technicians how to install them.  My exhaust pipes flanges were only finger-tight after they installed them, this caused play which damaged the aluminum of the heads.  Nothing terrible being I caught it quickly enough and fixed it myself. This in my opinion is entirely UNSAT.  I had scheduled my bike to be dyno-tuned with all my new parts in July.  It is now November and they have finally successfully tuned it.  Dyno issues were stated on the 3 times I had brought in the bike and tuner.  My father had his oil changed and they over-filled the reservoir which ended up spitting oil out once the bike was heated up.  No damage to the bike, although he required new pants at this point.  Overall, I would say the technicians are in general pretty inept and easily overlook things.  Definitely suggest double checking ALL work done by the Service Department when you get home.\n\nOverall:\nThe store and staff are always willing to help, pretty knowledgeable and don't ignore you.  The service department screwing up so badly is why I gave only 2 stars.  The business as a whole should get 3.5-4.0 stars if the service department sank into a sinkhole.",

Also I really loved the after dinner cocktail with espresso and vodka. \n\nThe bad: The food was good, though I wouldn't say it's in the same league as the best meals I've had (which was the way this place had been described to me). The real problem was the drink service. I ordered a glass of wine and it didn't come until I had to ask for it again (~20 minutes later). It happens, even at expensive places. The waiter apologized and said that it would be on the house. That's not completely necessary, but for a place of that caliber I do tend to expect that kind of service. But don't tell me you're going to, and not follow through. It would've been tacky for me to ask him why I was charged for it so I just left it alone and paid. It's nit picking I know, but when I spend that much, it's kind of what I expect. \n\nAgain, it wasn't a bad experience, it just could've been better and I was bummed especially after having such a great lunch earlier that day at a 1/4 of the price",

And likewise, when I think of carrot cake all I can think about is Strachan's.

It is simply the best there is.\n\nMost recently I purchased a cake for my step-dad's 60th bday. He is a picky eater, and a very picky dessert eater, but even he has a deep affection for this cake. The walk-up window is perfect for this time of social distancing. We were able to safely request our cake and pick it up. It was fresh and chilled. One might say the process was (I promised I wouldn't but here we are) a piece of cake! \n\nLater on in the evening we tried putting 60 candles in it...that didn't work out as well.

Probably not.\n\nThis week we are joined by a big group of folks. We got PepeRonnie, we got MaryNara, we got MegHeurita, heck we even got Crust.\n\nPlace is nice. Has got a New York theme to it. Pool tables in the back which are free to use I believe. We noticed there was nobody there. Might have just been the timing (Wed night). We ordered two 14″ pizzas. One was full Pepperoni, the other was White and Chicken Tikka. Each pizza was roughly $19. Waiter was nice. Food took forever, easily over 20 mins and not all at once. There were no customers, why so long?\n\n-Pepperoni-\nGood sauce. Cheese is okay. Kind of the gooey kind. Dough is not bad but just not anything interesting. Peps are okay. I mean everything is pretty much okay. This is not remotely close to New York style. It's just generic pizza.\n\n-White-\nSolid white pizza. Good white sauce. We were having trouble finding the chunks of chicken though. I think they go easy on the chicken.\n\n-Chicken Tikka-\nThis is one of their signature pizzas. We were expecting something crazy but what we got was an \"everything\" pizza with a few bits of orange-colored chicken added. You couldn't even taste the chicken really. Wish we had gotten the curry pizza instead because I've had that one before and it is much more interesting.\n\n-Verdict-\nThis place kinda sucks. I mean it's not bad, but the wait, the price, the boring food... I don't really see a point to coming here when Pizzalchik is down the street and the Chinden Guido's is like 5 mins away.

All of my friends in the Philly area are straight, so we usually end up at any of a number of awesome beer bars and/or dives, which is just fine by me. \n\nHowever, I always like to find a spot where I can have a nightcap and at least look at other boykissing boys...and maybe on the rare occasion, to find one I can at least have a normal conversation with (if not invite back to my hotel for a different sort of nightcapping).\n\nUnfortunately, most of the gay bars in Center City are at least as obnoxiously, stereotypically mediocre as the ones in NYC, and I end up wearing my iPod headphones to avoid the insanely loud (and dreadful) thump-thump dance music and slapping away the groping hands of muscle queens, dancing divas, and salacious creeps. I never thought a city could have as many awful, same-ish gay bars as NYC, but Philly most certainly fits the bill.\n\nOn my most recent visit, someone suggested a handful of places I should check out. Place number one: a \"sports\" bar with violently loud house music and shirtless bartenders. No thanks. Place number two: an overcrowded mess of clones in too-tight t-shirts and shaved heads, along with slightly less loud but just as awful house music. Again, not even worth approaching the bar to place an order.\n\nLike Goldilocks trying out ursine options, place number three was just right: U Bar!\n\nI had actually stumbled upon this spot a couple of years ago when colleagues and I were on a business trip, and we enjoyed a chill happy hour at the open front windows without even realizing it was a gay bar until it started to fill up with some of its usual clientele. My favorite kind of gay bar is one that doesn't scream \"GAY\" in your face the moment you walk in, so I told myself I'd have to come back...and then I summarily forgot where the joint was.\n\nI'm so glad I was referred back, because both nights I went in (Friday and Saturday) were kind of full, but also pretty friendly. I struck up conversations with strangers without feeling like I was being judged as a \"trick,\" the bartenders and bouncers were pleasant, and--a true blessing--there's a jukebox on which I was able to play Bad Religion, NOFX, and lots of other stuff that nobody fussed about, but which I'm pretty sure would have gotten me chased out of the queenier establishments I'd tiptoed into (and straight out of) on my way there.\n\nI shall return whenever I'm in town, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to the meth-soaked dance club vibe that is sadly the norm for gay establishments!",

We usually split a mercado salad and an entree and usually have left-overs since the portions are huge.

Chardonnay was light and fruity with a crisp taste on the lips. Delicious was the taste and great was the place. I would give it 4 stars. \nRecently, my step son and I go in with the understanding that it might not be the same. We were greeted and sat with menus. We noticed there was no happy hour, expectedly, but then waited 7 minutes for someone to come take our order. She admittedly forgot about us... but we were the only table inside and one other table on the outside makeshift patio in front of the restaurant. The wine though, was very hood.

You all know the potential stress of wedding planning whether or not you are a particular perfectionist or laid back... we encountered relatively few roadblocks, but eventually our minds locked onto Jen's florals as the one thing we didn't have to worry about.  It helped that we met and brainstormed with her in person, and saw that she is a genuinely caring person, one who takes delight in the small details of others, generous, cheerful,  observant, and truly excited about plants and flowers.  I guess our tastes agreed, or else maybe she just wasn't judgy or overbearing about imposing her preferences on us. She welcomed photographic examples and we shared a board on Pinterest.  Her proposal was very fair, detailed, and specific, and she was always responsive to our questions.  She gave us her log-in so we could peruse all the wholesale vase and votive options (you might be able to find a better price online, but make sure you are comparing apples to apples).  In one email, I may have sounded a little panicked about all the set-up I'd taken upon myself (this wasn't even a DIY wedding), and she volunteered her crew to lend a hand.\nOn the day of, our site was beset by unusual winds which caused us to lose some major decorative elements (draping, chandeliers, all candles).  Jen's survived -  her arch was staked with iron rods, but the tall aisle arrangements couldn't stay on their stands and had to be placed on the ground where they blew over, so I would suggest that they be wired to the end chairs if anyone encounters that problem.  Even the low centered, generously filled centerpieces would blow over, but they took a beating and still looked lovely.  Jen repurposed the flowers from the arch on the head table - fabulous!  I hope the photographers captured where she put those aisle pieces - I know they were placed somewhere because at the end of the evening, my completely unsentimental mother-in-law insisted on bringing one back to the hotel because it was too beautiful to leave behind.  \nI didn't know how Jen would capture the \"Romantic Bohemian Jungle\" theme in a succulent color palette, but she did it.  She found a specimen protea for Blakely's bouquet which must have weighed 10lbs. overall... but no worries, a tossing bouquet and loose flowers for misc. tables, hair, flower girls, and cake were included.  I wish I'd been more calm to have enjoyed them all that day, but the centerpieces I still have 9 days later, are still bringing me joy. \nSure it's great when things are delivered as promised, but I feel that Jen went beyond that with her pleasant attitude.  She was a ray of happiness during the set-up while the wind was making a shambles of my little details, and I heard that at one point she ran in search of the groom for photos. As a wedding planner for the first time in 31 years, I didn't anticipate the importance of the vendors' positive attitudes... this is the kind of person you want involved in your happy occasion.",

My husband and another couple visited on a Saturday evening just in time for happy hour.  \n\nWe tried out the happy hour fries and wings as appetizers and had a round of drinks (excellent $3 happy hour price on one of the beers from Cigar City).  The fries were okay, but my friends said the wings were excellent.  Both of the guys in our group tried the Rise & Shine burgers and both of the burgers disappeared pretty quickly off their plates. My friend ate the Bruschetta Burger, which impressed me with a huge slice of mozerella cheese!  I felt adventurous and gave the Samurai Salmon Burger a whirl.  I'm a fan of avocado which the menu advertised atop the burger, but I found a bigger bite of cucumber instead. The burger was well-seasoned and came together really well either way.  Fried mac and cheese was also a hit as a side dish at our table. \n\nWe dined outside and the cars were pretty noisy going by on a busy highway so it may be wise to sit inside next time.  Staff were friendly and attentive.  The prices are steep so my tip for those who are frugal would be to enjoy the happy hour prices on drinks and apps and split a burger with someone.",

My boyfriend and I shared a pitcher of the blood orange mule and it was hands down the most refreshing, flavorful cocktail I've ever had. \n\nWe started with an order of meatballs and an order of the artichoke toasted ravioli, both of which were excellent. The toasted ravs had a tasty pesto sauce that accompanied it, a nice change from the typical red sauce you'll find elsewhere.\n\nI ordered the arugula reginette. As a mushroom lover, I wanted to love this dish more than I did, however, it was a little much for me. The dish was very rich and flavorful (the truffles were a great touch), but to the point that after 5-6 bites, I was overwhelmed by the richness. I still would say it's an excellent dish and definitely worthy of being tried by anyone with an appreciation for mushrooms. This would be a great one to split with someone and then share a salad with or something a bit lighter.\n\nMy boyfriend's choice was the winner of the night. He had the black spaghetti - squid ink dyed noodles with scallops, prawns, clams and salmon roe in a lemon butter sauce. The umami packed in this dish was unbelievable. This was the best pasta dish either of us has had before - I definitely was envious I had not ordered it for myself. The seafood was tender and was surprisingly not overpowered by the sauce of the dish - something that is hard to find in restaurants pairing seafood and pasta.\n\nAlthough I wanted to dive into the ricotta donuts with gelato and berries, we simply did not have the room. Guess we'll have to be back to dine again in the near future! \n\nMoving on to the atmosphere, I was very disappointed. As I mentioned, it was our New Year's Eve date night and I made a 6:45 reservation. While there were plenty of open tables, we were seated on a 2 person high top that was against the pony wall shared with the kitchen. Not only was it extremely noisy and uncomfortably hot, but there was a huge column to my right that blocked views of the restaurant and had the server's station on the other side of it. It just made for a poor atmosphere, which was very disappointing when the night was meant to be a splurge from our usual date nights, as we don't normally spend $125 on the two of us for dinner.\n\nI will return to Katie's without hesitation. I see why the pasta has been voted best in St. Louis.",

Hey, it was crowded and some of the choices had an hour wait.  This place was busy too, but happened to have a table.  So they get to be my first meal at Xfinity Live. \n\nOverall atmosphere, OK it's a lot of fun.  It's loud.  There's country music and hard rock everywhere, and watching people fall off the mechanical bull provides lots of entertainment.  It's a whole load of cheesy, but I was into it.  \n\nBut the food, that's what I came for.  Here goes...\n\nChips and salsa were basic.  Not salty at all.  I was OK with that.  Decent salsa with a bit of a kick.  Good start if not totally exciting.  \n\nThe wife got a chicken salad which was served in a tortilla shell.  It was good pulled chicken which she said was quite juicy.  Not too bad overall.  The shell was a bit greasy to bite into which detracted slightly.  \n\nI went for the half BBQ chicken with rice and beans.  The plus is that the chicken was really juicy and fresh.  It came with dry rub, and if you wanted BBQ sauce that was on the table.  I felt that the taste of the chicken needed the sauce to be really good.  If the chickjen needs the sauce, it's not great BBQ in my mind.  But the sauce saved it.  It was tasty sauce.  I give them that.  The rice and beans needed work though.  Not enough flavor in those.\n\nIt's what I expected.  Corporate restaurants like this just don't always put out great food.  But it was good enough, and it was fun.  It's worth another try to see how the fajitas, burritos and tacos are.  They get 3 stars until they can prove that they deserve more.",

The service was slow and left much to be desired. The place was FREEZING a cold!! The food was average. I cannot say for sure because I did not ask, but I feel like some of the items are misleading.. I do not feel like the items on the menu are of the quality that they try to represent. The grouper however was delicious.. just thought it was funny that the item name was 'Real Grouper'... I also ordered the peel and eat shrimp.. they were dry, tough, no flavor..very poor. The green beans are canned as well. So for $24 I got a decent piece of fish, canned green beans and watery Brussel sprouts. I will say though that what the other people at the table ordered looked great! The conch fritters, gator bites, fish and chips, burger.. all looked great and came out hot. There was a soup that came out cold but was kindly replaced with a hot one. Now to be fair, I did not say anything to my server about my issues so I did not give him the opportunity to correct anything but honestly I'm not sure if new shrimp and a new side would've changed my opinion. These issues are not uncommon with beachside places in this area, unfortunately.. so if you are looking for high quality seafood then you'll need to get away from the beach bars and spend a lot more money, but if you're looking for a casual restaurant with decent food and a great view then this place will do",

This is one of the best tours I've ever taken. Jenn was knowledgeable, funny, engaging, had a great pace and just overall fantastic tour guide.

        "text": "This Banfield location (Nashville West, located in PetSmart) is unprofessional, deceitful, manipulative and most importantly not recognizing and reacting to a dying puppy. To summarize the situation, my 10 week old puppy was showing symptoms of Parvo the day before, middle of the night/early morning. He had been vaccinated at Banfield six days prior (the first of four needed for complete protection from parvo) as part of their Optimum Wellness Plan-Early Care.   After researching symptoms online and realizing the potential death risk I called Banfield to make an appointment. His symptoms became severe and his life was on the line because of this deadly disease. I proceeded to call Banfield again to let them know I needed to bring in my puppy as an emergency before my appointment time.  But I was given the response of, \"We cannot take your dog at this time, because we have another emergency coming in.\" After receiving this answer, I went ahead and headed to another responsible and willing hospital, Animal House (S. Nashville), in which was given exceptional care and assurance my puppy would be alright after treatment for the Parvo. Two days of amazing care at Animal House my puppy came home. The lack of professionalism and commitment, especially in an emergency of this Banfield branch towards Wellness Plan Members is completely unacceptable and not going to be forgotten. \nAfter trying to cancel my plan due to Banfield staff attitude towards my dying puppy, corporate stated that I have a remaining balance for the services they did while under my plan. I expressed to them that because this branch denied me emergency services, this remainder should be completely waived. After calling and talking with Ashley (practicing manager), she has responded with a scripted reply in which Banfield supposedly has policies that only the veterinarian is allowed to perform a Parvo test and the veterinarian assistants can only give a pedicure and clean animal's ears.  I questioned her and asked, \"what is the difference between pouring solution and cleaning it up with a cotton ball and inserting a Q-Tip into my puppy's rectum to get a fecal sample\"?  Ashley stated, \"I do not believe there is one.\" As the conversation went back and forth with me expressing my opinion about the unprofessionalism of their location denying my emergency of my animal, Ashley then proceeded (1 day later) after following up with her home manager and medical director about veterinarian assistants not being able to perform tests (after stating it was a TN State Law), she provided me with information that at Banfield the veterinarian must be present. Also, that this was actually not a policy or a law, but a \"standard of care\" Banfield abided by with patients. Through research I've found that the TN State Law states, \"No veterinary technician, veterinary student intern, or employee shall provide any professional services as covered by these rules without the responsible supervision of a licensed veterinarian, except that an employee of the veterinarian may be permitted to float teeth using non-motorized equipment without the physical presence of a licensed veterinarian as long as the employee is functioning under the supervision, control, and responsibility of the licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship.\" Responsible supervision is not Direct supervision, clearly the puppy could have been tested/treated by them at that time. By \"standard of care,\" Ashley stated that the veterinarian must perform a physical exam before testing of any sort. But WHY? The only way to diagnose Parvo is to test for it. I proceeded to ask where on the Banfield website these policies/\"standard of care\" documents could be located, but she had no idea and stated \"I will try to find this information for you, but we have a lot of policies.\" My question, what company has \"policies or standards of care\" that they continue to reference to customers, but cannot provide the written documentation of such? This information should be able to be provided to customers immediately, especially if Banfield staff is going to continuously reference them.\nAshley has given unprofessional customer service. To continuously refer to company's policies and TN State Laws (RULES OF TENNESSEE BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EXAMINERS CHAPTER 1730-03 GENERAL RULES GOVERNING VETERINARY TECHNICIANS) in which they have in place, but also not being able to follow up my questions/statements with accurate information is uncalled for on her behalf when representing a nation-wide company. I DO NOT recommend this location of Banfield services to anyone for the lack of professionalism, dishonesties, and trying to manipulate by saying whatever they think will make the customer go away. \nPlease go to another Vet Hospital! My experience luckily has a happy ending and my puppy is on his way to being healthy and happy again. I highly recommend Animal House in South Nashville.",

Delicious red sauces cooked in house, amazing meatballs, and antipasto trays to die for that included some of the best mortadela I've ever tasted. Don't even get me started on their fresh-baked Italian bread. If you're from up north, then you know real Italian bread is hard to find down here, but not anymore!\n\nI went to the actual store today for lunch and was torn between the \"30 napkin\" meatball sub, and the Italian.  I saw someone else order the meatball, and it was offensively MASSIVE.  I imagine a fork and knife is required because unless you're a retired porn actress, your mouth probably doesn't open that wide.  The freaking meatballs are the size of tennis balls.  No joke.\n\nI was wearing a shirt I really like, so I went the less-saucy route and ordered an Italian sub.  As soon as the woman behind the counter grabbed the bread, I knew I wasn't gonna be able to take it down, so I immediately asked them for half to go.  The bread is probably 13 or 14 inches, but it's the girth that stands out.  This ain't no Publix or Subway bread.  This sandwich was big, thick and meaty.  And just to spice it up a bit, I added Capocollo to it.  What I ended up with was the best Italian sub I've had in Florida.  A full 5 out of 5 on my Italian sub scale.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that this place is a market and deli store that sells a lot of imported grocery items.  There are a few tables for those who wish to dine in, but while I was there, most people called ahead and got their orders to go.  \n\nI highly recommend this eatery!",

Her experience, warmth, and also her candor were major selling points for me, and I have absolutely zero regrets about hiring her not only for all four days, but for ancillary services like touch-ups and second looks as well. And I'm forever grateful for this woman because she kept me alive through what I didn't realize is going to be the biggest whirlwind of my life. And I'm not exaggerating about keeping me alive - she balanced Sprite and cut fruits with touch-up make-up to keep my blood sugar and make-up balanced throughout the day. I'm going to guess no one's bridesmaids (including my own) will or will remember to do this for you; it doesn't make them inconsiderate people, most people just don't have decades worth of experience helping a bride navigate the minutiae of their wedding day like Mar and her team does. But digress, her ancillary services are just another example of Mar and her team's dedication to excellent work and attention to detail in all aspects of HMU. I look back on photos and I still adore all the looks we crafted together. She made me feel effortlessly beautiful on my wedding day and helped me glam it up on other nights and they all photographed exactly as I wanted them to. Their range and ability to nail any look is truly phenomenal. And last, but certainly not least, Mar and her team are consummate professionals. They were always early AND finished early which is super important for wedding timelines. You'll likely need that extra time buffer for photos; I think we allocated 3 hours pre-ceremony and still needed more time which Mar's timeline thankfully provided; side note I also recently heard a horror story about a bride who's established HMUA did not budget enough time and left the bride for the end and couldn't finish her bridal make-up - can you imagine?! Taking in all these factors, I felt TEAM was well worth the price and honestly fell pretty closely in-line with the other vendors I vetted. If I had to do it over again, I would choose TEAM every time!",

And I'm so glad we went. Get ready for some gushing, guys. \n\nDrinks!\nC had lavender mint sweet iced tea. It was so good. I stole a drink of it and it was super refreshing. G had the citrus soda and I was really jealous. I LOVE citrus sodas so I'm frankly surprised I didn't get this for myself. I stole a drink of this one, too. E got the orange juice and it is fresh-squeezed, ya'll. Like, \"this tastes like eating oranges\" fresh-squeezed. I obviously stole a drink of this. I got the \"Before We Begin\" and it was legit. It had a kick to it that got better and better as the meal went on. My only complaint here was that the drinks don't have free refills. They also have pitchers of water at the table but I wish they were iced. I love me some ice water. \n\nFood!\nWe started out splitting a peanut butter and jelly kolache. It was really good, but honestly was my least favorite part. G got the fiesta fried chicken wings. This was the only thing we got that I didn't try. But G and C both said they wanted infinity of those wings. They were that good. E got the sourdough pearl sugar waffle and I ate too much of it. Like, too much. Word of caution: the pimento cheese is spicy. Like, it tasted like jalapeño cream cheese (and I loved it and wish I could get it on a bagel, but I digress). E didn't like the cheese, but it was just a dollop on top and I scooped it off without her noticing it too much. \n\nC and I split the potato and celeriac latke and I wish it was bigger. It was so flavorful and I loved the tomato jam. I took some of the aforementioned pimento cheese and it kicked it up a notch. We also split the tomato and cucumber tabbouleh Dutch baby pancake. It reminded me of a Mediterranean dish and it was well balanced. \n\nTL;DR:\nWhat can I say, Milktooth lives up to the hype for us. It was as good as we expected and that's saying something.",

It was slightly tucked away between two buildings - marked with a badass hop-skull hovering above an arrow ... pointing down to a basement entrance! I thought \"crud, it'll be all cool folks with piercings and gauges and tats. I'm going to stand out like skunky beer.\"\n\nWe entered the venue into a dim narrow hallway, which opened up into a lively venue with a great ambiance!  Though there are no windows, key aspects drew my focus to the human experience - community seating, helpful staff, and friendly customers.  Rare and awesome combo.\n\nFood:\n* BBQ Glazed Meatballs: $7. Ground sirloin, scrapple (!!!), Thai BBQ glaze, aged cheddar.\n* House Pizza: $8. Kennett Square cremini mushrooms, prosciutto, plum tomatoes, roasted garlic, basil, fresh mozz on flatbread.\n\nWe had to try something with mushrooms:  I visit the mushroom man at the Rittenhouse Market, and Kennett Square has been this magical mushroom mecca in my mind!  Both dishes did not disappoint: we expected standard bar bites, but these blew me away - they were bursting with flavor and perfectly portioned!  Look at the photos and try not to lick the screen! \n\nBeer: opted for the $9 flight.\n* Wiley Rye (IPL: 9.4%)\n* Mighty Suskey (Belgian Saison: 8.5%)\n* Head Skull Mind Beer (Double IPA: 7%)\n* Wee Wobbly Scottish 100 Schilling (Scotch Ale/WeeHeavy: 5.5%)\n\nSome beers overpower you with HOPS HOPS HOPS ... or sweet talk you with saccharine fruit flavors. Not these! Each beer had mature, subtle notes to their character.  I usually ditch one of a flight on the hubs, but we shared every last one - we liked them all!\n\n$24 for beer and food for two - we left with both hearts and bellies full. We just returned to revisit the brewery while attending the mushroom festival: http://mushroomfestival.org/the-festival/. The only downside for our second visit was the limited menu (drumsticks and mac and cheese were ok) due to the festival, but will definitely be back when we visit Longwood Gardens' Nightscape!\n\nLong story short: Good food, good beer, good people, good vibes.  I'm a fan - highly recommend!",

        "text": "To date, Commander's Palace has been the best dining experience I've had in NOLA.  It's not just the delicious food, or the amazing 25 cent lunch martini's, or the classy 'old-school' building.  It's all of that, but it is the service which puts the Palace above the rest.  Commander's Palace has mastered the art of fine dining service and has put it on another level.  My experience at the Palace was everything I had hoped for and more!\n\nWhat makes the service here so much better than any other fine dining restaurant in the city?  To start, you don't get one server, you get a team of three servers (or 'gang service' as they call it).  Our team of  Sarah, Nash and Lauri were just  fantastic.  Here, they don't refill your water glass, they replace it.  All of your dishes are presented at the same time by different servers.  If you have a party of four, then four servers will put down all four plates at once.  There is a bit of choreography going on here among the servers which is quite interesting to watch.  There are signals they use to let each other know what stage of service each table is at (i.e. once the initial drink order has been taken, the waiter will move the salt and pepper shakers together to let other servers know that  this has happened).  The Palace also came up with the idea of Food Runners.  They are staff whose sole job is to take food from the kitchen to the dining room.  This keeps the service team in the dining room, free to tend to the guests.  Food runners are common in most fine dining restaurants but usually they also serve the food.  At the Palace, only your team serves the food, not the runners.  This greatly adds to the art of the service.\n\n   Yes it's true, you can get excellent Turtle Soup,  Bananas Foster,  Gumbo, etc. at many other locations throughout NOLA (as I have).  But what I've never had anywhere else but here, is the exceptional quality of service.   After our meal, we were given a tour throughout the restaurant by one of our servers, Nash.  We were given as much time as we wanted (we got to visit the wine cellar and speak to one of their Sommeliers as he was cataloging their recent wine shipment.  It was great).   Also of note, the valet is complimentary.    \n\nCommander's Palace is a must for anyone who appreciates fine dining and I truly hope you will be as pleased with your visit as I was.  The Palace gets my patented four thumbs up!",

        "text": "Jiffy Lube, as you probably know, specializes in lightening-fast oil changes and other basic service operations on motor vee-hickles. You drive around to the back and leave your car with a tech while you're escorted to the waiting room by another tech. They work while you wait, and you're gotta there in a flash.\n\nPros: fast, friendly, quality service at affordable rates. I have rarely spent more than 15 minutes here from start to finish. Love it. Prices for parts such as windshield wipers and filters seem fairly standard, and you have a choice of three or four different types and grades of motor oil. The \"signature service\" is an oil change that comes with a tire pressure check, fluid check, and other such stuff. The price is around $25 for this with the conventional oil; my car has 120,000 miles on it so I pay extra for the high-mileage oil.\n\nCons: service techs make suggestions for additional services based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but don't take the specific make of your car into consideration. This means that I  always having to listen to their spiel about having front differential service performed on my rear-wheel drive car, and they're trying to get me to replace a non-existent cabin air filter. Mildly annoying but not really a big deal.\n\nThe waiting room itself is very small and only has about 7 chairs, but the service crew works so quickly that this has never been a problem. They get you in and out, boom boom boom. The waiting room has the usual assortment of magazines and coffee; all of the staff members I've encountered behind the register have been friendly and competent.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place!",

It's innovative, fun, tasty and drinks are super yummy, too.\n\nI really love the variety. You can go back over and over again and never get sick of tacos because you can reinvent your order every single time.  I'm a huge fan of the fancy shells. The one with bacon refried beans is amazing and takes a typical taco to a whole new level. The nachos (called something else) are a table favorite every time. I also like that the chips are so reasonably priced. It's a no-brainer add-on for $1.50. My personal preference is the salsa verde--tastes really crisp and fresh. The roja was meh--nothing special.\n\nMy chief complaint is the noise level--hence the four stars. We've been during the week and it was so much more pleasant. When I've been at night on the weekends, it's super loud, especially when the restaurant is crowded. It's not a show-stopper, but I wouldn't bring my parents. : )\n\nGo to Condado.

Everything inside is new,  as the space has been remodeled. Yet upon walking in, the whole place already smells of grease and fish. I'm guessing it will always be as such but worse with time because this is a one stop shop hodge podge of wings,  seafood,  sandwiches, smoothies, and gyros. Next, we approach the counter to an altercation already in progress. The customers already here are telling us to go unless we want to wait 45 minutes for wings. Well,  already I'm intrigued,  and rarely one to listen to others rantings,  we proceed to order a strawberry smoothie and hot wings. I paid with my card,  which I immediately think might have been another potential headache on its own. They ran it,  reversed it,  and charged it again. We sat down and waited 15 minutes for a smoothie, which was OK. We did indeed wait 45 minutes for the wings, which were good. For medium,  they had a kick and were tasty. Noteworthy, they only have ranch,  no blue cheese. Another customer threw a fit about that. The ranch was not good. Very generic. If you're a dipper, and I am,  no or bad dip can be reason enough for me to give up on wings. Several customers were asking for their wings cooked hard because they were coming out a little underdone. They had no cocktail sauce for the seafood. There is also a language barrier that was contributing to order errors and lengthy turn around times. I don't typically like trying out places on opening day because there are always bumbles, but even taking that into consideration,  this fledgling business had alot of hurdles to jump.",

We were having the best time, and then the chicken came and we literally were swooning.  My husband has a distant connection to the Colonel - and that guy can eat his heart out.  Compared to Willie Mae, he serves chicken - she serves nectar.  Yeah, it was slow, and I was not enamoured of the sides.  I would suggest ordering two plates each, and picking through the sides.  But I guarantee the chicken will be reduced to bones - and all of them sucked clean.  Whatever you pay, it is an adventure.  Also, look up Willie Mae Seaton on the internet.  She is a treasure.",

        "text": "Giving this spot two stars for the happy hour and game specials but I cant rationalize more after being at this bar on Saturday evening (4/20/2013).\n\nMy fiance and I sat at the bar before the crowd rolled in. Got our first drinks in a timely manner but then refills took far too long to get. There were two bartenders at that point and maybe 15 people to serve so not sure why they were so lax about service, unless they just were inattentive to empty glasses/bottles. \n\nLater in the evening came one of the worst displays of service I've seen in a place. A couple was overcharged on their bill (I know because we had some of the same things and they were charged more for them). It was pointed out to the bartender who argued then I assume fixed it. The couple then mentioned to each other in a personal conversation that service there was really bad that night. One of the bartenders then interjected in that conversation to tell them about how crowded the place was and how 4 bartenders cant manage a bar effectively. Come on - I've seen 1 bartender manage a full bar effectively, you just have to be a good bartender and with four people you can absolutely manage a crowd. Sadly it did not stop there. The patron was justifiably annoyed with being overcharged and the unwarranted intrusion to his personal conversation and got upset. The bartender then continued acting unprofessional by using vulgarity with the patron loud enough for us and others to hear. Just awful, the place needs to train these bartenders and give the tall bald one a serious training session so he realizes that patrons keep the bar in business and pay his bills. \n\nConclusion: That probably cost Cuddy's those peoples future business. My fiancé and I will not be back after seeing that and will instead be going to Christopher's down the block which has always had fantastic service - even if it is crowded. People in the bar are paying customers and these paying customers did nothing to warrant that treatment. I am very understanding of people having bad days, being frustrated with an overcrowded and noisy/rowdy bar but this situation was escalated by the staff, not handled in a professional way.",

This was one of the very few times that I was floored by how delicious the food was. Fiance and I were searching for a place to have our rehearsal dinner, and after our first stop at a nearby restaurant had nearly destroyed our appetites and ruined our spirits for the day, we needed to find something good to eat. \n\nWe were the first folks in for dinner, and had the full attention of our waiter, John. He could not have been more genuinely concerned with answering our questions, and was really on point with menu knowledge and service. He is really a great and personable server. Out and about on wedding-related missions all day, we were dressed fairly casually in jeans and sneakers (which I only took personal inventory of later on when I saw that other customers definitely dressed up a bit more- slacks and collared or polo shirts or sweaters for guys, ladies in pants/skirts), but I did not feel for a minute out of place nor was I made to feel out of place. Unpretentious- check!    \n\nNow to the tasty part: the food. Delicious, fresh bread served with good, quality olive oil for dipping. We ordered the artichoke appetizer, which was delicious: hot, fresh, cooked nicely and seasoned appropriately. The combination of the cooked artichoke and olive oil created a delicious reduction that we dipped the artichoke bits into. \n\nWe then split the tuna special, which came with a tasty, zingy, puttanesca sauce that complimented the understated flavor of the tuna ( finance likes his tuna cooked medium... I know, I know.. and since we were food tasting at different restaurants in the area, we ordered it cooked this way). The platter also came with grilled scallops that were very nicely done. We also ordered a small plate of the hazelnut ravioli. This was superb. Pasta tasted homemade ( we forgot to ask, but fairly certain it was), was cooked perfectly to al dente, and the filling and accompanying sauce were simply delicious. I have reached my \"delicious\" maximum, but I am not embellishing, I swear!\n\nWe somehow fit in cannoli for dessert: again, we were not disappointed. The cannoli had some stiff competition with its predecessors, but it was really pretty good. I *have* had better, but it was very good none the less and ranks up there with the best. \n\nThe restaurant filled up quickly and all at once ( which can be a nightmare for the staff), but the servers worked together and we were attended to frequently and without a hitch.\n\nAll in all, I am extremely happy we found this place. We will definitely be returning and  feel very good about choosing this establishment to have our rehearsal dinner. We know we will give our family and friends a great, well-deserved and memorable dining experience!!",

They had hired Big Helpful Gentlemen Moving company to provide the truck and move the large items based on their reviews and their BBB standing.  They were scheduled to arrive at 8:00 am. At 7:00am we began hauling boxes to the lobby to make it easier for the movers. At 8:45, we had not heard from Big Helpful Gentlemen Movers, so we called them. They told us that one of their employees had called in sick and they were running late. They assured us that they would be there by 9:00.  We were fine with that, even though they should have called to tell us that.  At 9:30, we still hadn't seen or heard from the movers. So again, we called them.  This time we were told they would be there by 10:00.  When we were still waiting on them with no word at 10:30, we decided it was either a scam or just a very unprofessional, unreliable company. At this time we called BEK movers, who were in the process of a job, but said they could help us later in the afternoon when they completed their current job.  To our complete surprise, BEK showed up before 12:00 noon, and got busy.  Thank goodness, because the Big Helpful Gentlemen Moving Company NEVER SHOWED UP! We didn't even hear from them until SIX HOURS AFTER they were scheduled to be there, when they sent an EMAIL (they did not call) apologizing for not showing up. SERIOUSLY??  We were depending on them to be there at 8:00am and they literally NEVER SHOWED UP!  If it hadn't been for our luck of finding BEK Movers, we would've been left standing there with a house full of furniture that needed to be moved.  How the Big Helpful Gentlemen Moving Company has such great reviews is beyond me. The only thing I can come up with is that they are phony reviews. I can't possibly believe that they went from being a stellar company to taking a deposit, making a commitment, and then NOT EVEN SHOWING UP AT ALL!  Not only do I not recommend this company, but I want to warn everyone out there looking for a moving company to not even consider Big Helpful Gentlemen Moving.  They are the exact opposite of what their name implies. Call BEK movers for a hardworking, courteous moving company that can be depended on.

The spicy sweet sauce was much better than many other restaurants which often tend toward a super sweet syrupy sauce. This one was tangy and of a thinner consistency. Loved them.\n\nWonton soup. I would not usually order a dish typically associated with Americanized Chinese food from a Thai restaurant, but boy am I glad I did. I was intrigued by the description on the menu which described a wonton soup with fish sauce, cilantro and bean sprouts...soundly very Thai-like in nature. It did not disappoint. The broth was delicate in flavor and complemented by the meaty chicken wontons. There was no doubt that this tasty soup was a Thai inspiration.\n\nThe larb salad was the highlight of the meal. Fresh and crisp cabbage, thinly sliced red onion, crunchy peanuts and sliced green onion balanced with the ground pork, fish sauce and lime juice to make one of the best larb salads I've had the pleasure of eating. I enjoyed being able to get it Thai hot, and it was that. Not overly seasoned, but a balanced spice to still bring out the key flavors of the dish.\n\nAll at a reasonable price point: $4 rolls, $8 salad and $4 soup.\n\nI will definitely be ordering from here again.\n\n(I was super hungry and forgot to take pictures first...my bad.\n\nOrdered from here off of BiteSquad for office delivery, so I can't comment on the locale itself.)",

So close to my house, sounds really cool, looks really cool, great beer/whiskey selection, etc...right up my ally.\n\nSo my 3 yr old son and I came in and we ordered drinks and wings to start.  He got milk.  He then told me it tasted like old cheese.  So I tasted it and it turns out he was served soured whipping cream (at least I hope that's what it was).  Whatever, no big deal, ordered water and moved on.\n\nGot the wings and I have to say they were some of the worst wings I have ever had.  The chicken itself had that mushy barely cooked texture and had no taste, the \"sauce\" was some kind of watered down BBQ/Asian sauce or something that also had no taste, and then they were \"charred\" which unfortunately was the only taste.  My son took one bite and spit it out (this kid dominates chicken wings) and I could not eat more than a couple of bites of each wing.  But...OK whatever, I moved on and looked forward to the burger we ordered to split.\n\nI ordered medium.  I got charred outside, raw inside.  I'm cool with some medium rare here and there but when there is no difference between raw cold mushy ground beef and whats inside of my burger...that's a problem.  So I dug it all out to try and salvage some of our meal and had a pile of raw meet sitting on my plate.  My son and I just nibbled the outside of the burger and he just ate the bread.

I was with my 3 yr old so I didnt get to enjoy all of the whiskeys and great craft beers but Im sure I will come back to have some drinks.  But man o man I can not envision ever coming back to eat.  So bummed, hopefully I caught them on a really off night.  I would love for this place to get better and thrive.",

When I realized I hadn't been in years, the SO and I decided to take a trip back home to see the family and pay the fair a little visit.\n\nThings I like to do: eat, see the animals, walk around and look at the crafts, and see if there are any fun events. Normally I don't shop too much, but there are a lot of educational stands or areas to learn about ag and Indiana-based farming. It's always fun to look at. The goats, horses, and llamas are my favorites. Highlight with the animals this year was petting a pretty llama with stars shaved into her coat!\n\nThey have a big ride/midway section, but I'm never into that stuff, but if you are or have kids - go. It's bright, colorful, and will keep their attention for probably more time than you need.\n\nFood is abundant and we always go for the fried stuff. SO, not being from Indiana, was curious about the plethora of fried goods. He settled on a deep fried Snickers to start, then a corn dog and we shared a tenderloin and some corn. This year they actually had a beer/wine area, so we met up with the folks and did some sampling there.\n\nOverall, it's fun with a lot to do. I'd love to return next year!",

We only had to wait about ten minutes for a table outside on a Friday night  with beautiful weather even though the place looked pretty crowded.  \n\nThere is a large beer list to choose from, and a small, though interesting, cocktail list that seems to change with the seasons.  I started the evening off with Miss June, a Varga Julep, composed of bourbon, campari, fresh mint, simple syrup, and grapefruit juice.  I usually don't like bourbon alone, but with this combination it was refreshing and didn't have too much bite.  Later I tried the Miss August, Pucker Up, composed of apple vodka, watermelon pucker, fresh lime, and club soda.  It wasn't bad, but didn't wow me.  It seemed a little weak, and I was hoping for more of a jolly rancher flavor that I've had in similar cocktail combinations before.  \n\nTo fill our tummies after a long work day, we started off with the fried pickles since they were so highly reviewed on Yelp.  They were hot and crispy.  I also think I prefer them to Memphis Tap Room's as the ones at Varga are smaller but not slices and there is some tasty spice or flavor in the batter that I like, but can't quite detect what it is.  For my entree, I had the crab-cake sandwich with crab fries.  The sandwich was topped with crisp fresh coleslaw and the crabby patty had big hearty chunks of crab-meat in it.  The fries were just basic shoestring fries with old bay on them, but they came out hot and fresh. My significant other had the short-rib sandwich, also a generous portion, and he said it was very tasty.  We left stuffed and happy.  \n\n I agree with fellow Yelper Vichet O. that the place does look expensive, but the menu is surprisingly reasonable.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying other menu items, especially the veggie burger which sounds amazing.",

Uber is so much more than a car service, it is so convenient and I always feel extremely classy and important when I show up somewhere in a black town car with a snazzy dressed driver.\n\nEverything is done through their app.  You open it up and let the GPS locate you.  Once you look at the map, you notice the available cars in your area because they are pictured on the map!  \n\nTime to request your car: you can request Uber X (Their less expensive answer to uber--cheaper than a cab), a black town car (UberBlack), Uber XL (an SUV at a lower cost--the uber x of suv),  UberSUV (Uberblack version with SUV rather than a town car), and Uber WAV (wheelchair accessible).\n\nThe cars are always in very good condition, very comfortable, clean, and the drivers friendly.  Many often offer bottled water, car chargers for phones, candy/snacks, etc. to their riders as well!\nI also feel safe in my Uber.  I like that I have the name of my driver, make/model of the car, and license plate number before the car gets to me.  I also like that a map of my route is sent to my email with driver information with my receipt.  \n\nTheir customer service is also awesome.  Drivers are pretty much always fantastic, but if you do have any kind of issue, their customer service reps are extremely responsive!  I always try to leave feedback since after your rides, you rate your drivers and when I leave glowing reviews, the customer service reps actually contact me to say thank you and to let me know that me feedback means a lot to them!\n\nIf it is a very busy time of day, keep in mind that there might be a price surge.  You are always alerted of this upon requesting a car, but sometimes this can make the ride a bit pricey. Also, drivers sometimes need you to punch the address of the destination into the GPS on the app or will ask directions because they don't always know their way around the city like a cab driver would. I would say that is my only complaint with Uber.\n\nUber also often has great deals and discounts.  A few times, I was emailed a code for free airport rides or special deals for certain days!\n\nThey also do special things like christmas tree delivery, or bagels on Monday morning when you get in the car.  On valentines day, drivers gave out flowers, they recently did ice cream delivery on national ice cream day...There are a bunch of other things they do, I can't name them all!  \n\n When you recommend friends, and you can get discounts for both you and the person signing up.  Also, it is super easy to split the ride with friends!  Again, this is all done through the app on your phone, just make sure that if you are splitting a ride, to do it before you get in the car or while you are in the car because after the ride is finished, you might not be able to split or have to contact customer service. All you do is tap \"split fare\" and request the person you are splitting with.  Once they accept the split, the fare is divided evenly.",

I've stayed here every week for the last year, and I'm still not sick of it, so theyr'e doing something right! \n\nAmenities:\nFitness center - Open 24 hours. Well-equipped: 4 treadmills, 2 bikes, an elliptical machine, a universal weight machine, free weights, yoga mats, etc.\nIndoor pool and hot tub - Open early (6:00 AM?) until 11:00 PM\nExecutive lounge - 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM, but is closed on days with light occupancy.  If you are entitled to lounge access you usually have to remind the staff, because they never seem to code the room keys right the first time around\nStarbucks - open 'til 6:00 PM and does not take Starbucks gift cards (there's also a Starbucks at the Marriott next door, but the Westin's Starbucks sells sandwiches which makes it slightly more viable as a lunch spot)\nRoom Service - Poor value but the food's OK.\nStaff - very helpful and friendly. Lower turnover than some Starwoods I've stayed at.\nShuttle - There isn't one. It's about a $25 taxi ride including tip from the airport.\nBeds - \"heavenly\" (although personally I've always thought that's an overstatement)\nToiletries - Upgraded rooms include mouthwash and lotion, and sometimes....very rarely.....free bottled water. \nRoom decor - Sage green and grey. The hotel was remodeled in 2006 so it's all pretty new.\n\nThe biggest thing to watch out for is their dry cleaning service. I'm not sure which local business they use, but whoever it is has lost a handful of pieces of my colleagues' clothing over the last year.\n\nWhat's *not* worth 4 stars is the way they treat the staff - the hotel shoeshiner told me he works purely for tips and isn't paid any kind of hourly wage, and one of the doormen was featured in a local newspaper story about the low wages that area hotels get away with.  I soothe my conscience with regular tips.\n\nOverall, a very comfortable place to stay.  They seem to attract huge conventions pretty much year-round, yet the staff doesn't seem overextended.",

Has a small outdoor seating area.\n\nSERVICE: Fantastic.  They clearly train their staff to know so much about their food and drink selection.  They made one mistake and brought out the entrees before our appetizer.  They apologized and offered a free dessert which was phenomenal!\n\nFOOD: Fantastic!!!  Not huge portions, but excellent quality, which is what I prefer.  I got the saccheti pasta which was little purse-string style raviolis filled with cheese and proscuitto in a chunky tomato sauce.  It was fantastic - I loved the chunks of veggies in the sauce which really stood out.  My boyfriend got the ricotta cavatelli which was very light and airy but so so flavorful.  Would be perfect on a hot day on their patio.  For dessert we got the special which was a warm cherry and nut cake with ginger and black pepper marscapone topping and diced strawberries - yum!!!!  It was a perfect example that you don't need to be over-the-top sweet to make a fantastic dessert!  Pastas were $12-14 and desserts $7-8.\n\nDRINKS:  Huge wine selection, and able to be purchased in sizes ranging from small tastes to share-able portions.  Staff knowledgeable about options.  Unfortunately, while the food was very reasonably priced, the alcohol was expensive.  Most normal-sized glasses of wine started at $12 and went up to $30s.  This is clearly where they make their money.\n\nOVERALL:  I would definitely return for the fantastic food and great service.  Not sure how much drinking I will do because of the cost.  I wish they had a couple of less expensive wines available.",

A woman saw me walk in and walked over the the desk and smiled and said hello. \"Can I help you?\" she said. \"I have a one o'clock appointment for a pedicure.\" I said. She asked me name and my address. Then she told me to pick out a polish color as she pointed to the polish rack. I went over to pick from what seemed a limited collection of colors. I wanted a bright pink but the closest they had was coral or magenta.\n\nThe salon was well decorated with muted earth tones. Nothing very eye catching but not at all dull. There was good quality furniture all throughout the salon and the occasional retro touch with an old book on hairstyling or an circa 1920's wall art piece.\n\nThe salon looked very clean but I was very hard to tell if the technician had cleaned her implements before or after using them on me. The implements and products were places on a bamboo place mat that is impossible to sanitize. The pedicure chair had light on it to indicate if it had been sanitized but the light was not on. The chair had internal jetting, which always makes me nervous. And the chair next to me that was not being used had water spots and streaks on it. Could have been cleaner or could have been from the previous pedicure water. There was a bottle of bleach cleaner in the pedicure room.\n\nSandy was the manicurist doing the service. She was very nice and well dressed with a cute zebra print skirt. I followed her to the pedicure room and the pedicure tub was already filled and jets running. She had me start by putting my feet into the water. After a very short soak, she took one foot out removed old polish, shortened filed toes nails. She then pushed back my cuticles and smoothed out the nails with a buffer then applied a \"sugar scrub\". After that she applied a lotion and did a foot massage. Her movements were fast and although I did enjoy the massage it was mediocre at best. Next was polish...I had chosen a shimmery coral color. She applied base coat, two coats of color and then top coat. Then without missing a beat applied cuticle oil. Now, as a manicurist myself I know that polish drys through evaporation. Polish cannot dry when covered with oil. There was so much oil my flip flops were all oily when I got home. Plus when she was applying the oil she put her finger into the polish on my big toe and then reapplied more polish after the oil was on the nail. That nail is now very thick with polish. But the worst was the lotion. I think it was Hempz and I just hate the smell of that stuff. I gives me a headache. But most people love it. \n\nThe one thing that defines a pedicure is a good polish job. This was not. My feet were slipping around in my flip flops from all the lotion. I had to walk very gingerly. I would recommend bringing your own polish with you since their selection is not the best. I paid $46 for a 30 minute pedicure. This is a little on the high side. For the money, go somewhere else.",

The service is pretty special here. I always feel welcome, and even though they are so busy all the time the staff makes you feel like they're happy you're there. We had a little situation last weekend where we waited a long time despite having a reservation, and when we were seated the manager came over and was very apologetic- they also gave us a free pizza and free dessert.\n\nThe decor is beautiful here. I love the dimly lit setting with a bit of a retro/vintage vibe. It feels very nostalgic and modern at the same time, if that makes sense at all...\n\nA couple of food items here are dishes I literally think about often. First is the speck and egg pizza. It sounds so weird, and everyone who has tried it agrees with me that it's so special. We get it every time we are here. The veal tartare app is also amazing, but was recently removed from the menu sadly. I hope it comes back soon. The pastas are usually pretty outstanding as well.\n\nLastly, the drinks are very well made here. I always order the cocktails from their menu because they are so different and just work well.

Here is the low-down on each of them: \n\nRed velvet: AN ABSOLUTE MUST!  This might be THE best red velvet concoction I've ever had.  The cake was perfectly light and moist, but it had the rich devil food flavor and the vanilla icing oozing out of the center was an indulgent, sinful surprise.  Top it off with the buttercream frosting - it was pure perfection.  You won't regret it. \n\nStrawberry lemonade: Like the red velvet, this blew us away.  Despite being January and the freezing temperatures outside, my first bite into this cupcake transported me to the dog days of summer.  The strawberry cake was fluffy, and the lemon frosting - OH MY.  It literally tasted like I was drinking lemonade.  How can frosting do that?!?!  That I'll never know...but it was amazing. \n\nWedding cake:  This is a \"neutral\" flavor that will likely suit those who don't have a particularly sweet tooth.  For me though, I thought it was slightly bland, but I also have an inhumanly high threshold for sugar.  The cake was baked perfectly, like with the above flavors, and the presentation was flawless.  I just wished they brought out more vanilla or almond flavor. \n\nChocolate chip cooke dough:  PASS.  This was a huge disappointment, but I don't hold it against Gigi's.  This is simply a flavor that sounds delicious in theory but just does not translate well into cupcake form, no matter the baker.  It was just extremely dense compared to the others and fairly dry.  It also had an odd, sandy texture to it, but I guess they were trying to replicate the crumbs of dry dough.  Again, I would not recommend getting this flavor. \n\nAnd for all those complaining about the frosting - they are CUPCAKES, not muffins, shesh!  There would be much more outrage if there wasn't enough of the good stuff!  Please don't change your generous amounts of frosting :)",

There is a good selection of different kinds of produce, including the cheapest portobello mushrooms I've ever seen, and the highest quality asparagus I've laid my hands on. \n\nTwo is that it has put some serious effort into *atmosphere*. Musicians and performers, and lots of festival like events that go right through the marketplace means that you get entertainment that frequents the area. Chinese festival, pride parade, swing dancers and I'm sure more to come. \n\nThree is that the local businesses put out a lot of energy into supporting and working with the market, so you have a great mix of permanent and temporary businesses set up in the area.\n\nAnd also there are the crafters (of which I'm one of them). Local craft mostly (some imports), you can find leather accessories, bird houses, quilts, fine jewelry, clothes and more.\n\nThis market has the biggest potential to become a really major attraction for the city out of all the markets I've participated in.

I would definitely eat before arriving, or stepping out for a bite to eat. I also wasn't a huge fan of the hand pumped doughnut, but I did like my everything bagel with scallion cream cheese.",

Sit in the porch and watch the street cars to by. Their big round tables are good for large groups. Get there early to get a table! Wine ($4/glass), cocktails ($3 wells), beer ($1 off) are on happy hour. I don't think they have any food specials, but we usually get some charcuterie or a cheese plate to share. The best thing is that the happy hour ends late- 4 to 7PM!\n\nSunday brunch:\nFirst, do not be mislead by the term \"jazz brunch.\" Every time I've been there has just been one guitarist, strumming peaceful and nice music, but not what I was expecting. When you come for brunch, make sure to set aside at least 2-3 hours because service has been slow every time I've gone. If a waiter doesn't come by early on, flag one down because they may have forgotten to assign one to you! \n\nThe food is pretty average. It's a 4 course prix fixe menu and includes a mimosa or sparkling wine for $40. Choose a soup, salad, entree, and dessert. The options change a little, but I've gotten shrimp and grits every time. It's pretty standard, meets expectations, nothing to write home about. It's a nice place to take a guest for brunch, if you have time and want a leisurely brunch with a nice atmosphere. But if you focus on the food alone, there are plenty of better brunch options.",

We switched for the last night to save some money. It was comfortable and the interior design of the lobby and rooms were creative and aesthetically pleasing. The breakfast was quality and nutritious: omelettes with cheese, decent bacon, american potatoes, fruit, hardboiled eggs, yogurt, prepared oatmeal, etc. This is really key for me, as I care a lot about nutritious food. The lobby had nice, comfortable chairs and a fireplace! Our room was beautiful. Gorgeous drapes, soft, comfortable sheets and blankets. The bathroom was updated and just so nice. There is really something to be said about the cleanliness of the room. It was really noticeable how well cared for. And all of the staff were very friendly. If I would have known how nice this place was, I would have stayed here all week and driven to Opryland for my conference. That should really tell you how good this place is.",

The service is on point, atmosphere incredible, and the food is tasty!\n\nThe Vibes:\nI love their open seating bar section. In the middle of the room is a large bar table with a fireplace in the center. Like I said, it's all open seating, so last night I sat on a corner seat next to my friend, and then a random stranger was sitting just to the left of me. I kind of love this. It's the kind of seating/atmosphere that gives room for serendipitous moments to happen. The fireplace also gives a great ambiance, and there are huge windows all around that open up in the summertime. They also have TVs in this area with sports playing.\n\nThe Food:\nI've tried a few different things here-\n+ The Hummus Plate: pretty good, but I don't know if I would do it again. Not because it was bad, but there are other things on the menu I'd be interested to try out more.\n+ The Soba Noodles (add chicken): Again, very good. But again, I don't know that I would order them a second time. These noodles have a sweet teriyaki flavor and are packed full of veggies. \n+ Chicken Confit (My favorite thing I've tried so far): Chicken thigh served on a bed of mashed potatoes with a side of butternut squash and topped with a tarragon cream sauce. Oh, baby, the flavors - the perfectly cooked but juicy chicken thigh, and the creamy mashed potatoes. I ate every bite of this down to the bone. I would have probably licked the sauce off the plate too, but I didn't because that is not socially acceptable. Of all the things I've tried here, this one takes the cake! \n\nService:\nWe had an awesome server. He had great suggestions but was also very enthusiastic about my decision to order the chicken confit. He took care of us all night and stopped infrequently enough to get us what we needed, but not too much that it was overbearing. It was the perfect balance of being attentive and giving us room to have a great conversation!",

It's priced decently but service has always been just mediocre. Waitresses are snippy and take their time. 20+ mins just waiting for a check after it's been asked for etc. whatever, it's nearby and we deal. \nToday I was severely disappointed. I've worked as a bartender & waitress & manager for restaurants and have never treated a customer the way I was just treated. \nI get the same thing every time. It's sausage gravy with biscuits and eggs with cheese and hash browns. I eat the biscuits and let my daughter have the eggs with cheese and share the potatoes with her.\nToday it came all piled on top of each other where in the past 10+ times I've received it, it was separated among the plate. Not a big deal to the typical person but I'm that person that doesn't like my foods touching. I was kinda picking at it and wasn't gonna say anything but the waitress asked if everything was okay.. I was like honestly it usually doesn't come like this. I said, it's usually all separate not piled. She's like okay well maybe you ordered the wrong thing.. this one has cheese. I'm like yes, I know, I order this every time. I go we haven't been here in a month or so though so maybe that's it. She's like well next time ask for it to be separate. I'm like okay. Thanks. \nShe's like I guess I can ask them to fix it if you're not gonna eat it? I was like actually that'd be great. I'm really sorry! I felt bad but again, 39 weeks pregnant, they were closed a couple weeks ago when we tried to enjoy breakfast out and I just want to not have to cook and enjoy a meal that I've been looking forward to. #cravings\nI was like you can leave the hash browns so they don't have to redo those. But she walked away with the entire plate anyway. A minute passes and the cook walks out (older lady) tosses just the home fries on the table and says I've been here 10 years and have always made this the same way. You must have ordered the wrong thing. This one has cheese. I'm stunned and say \"yes, I know. I always get this one bc it does have the cheese.\" She's like well I've never separated it. I say\"okay.\" I didn't say anything else.. I have the waitress and cook coming at me..  are you the only cook ever? You're seriously gonna yell at the pregnant person that just wants to eat breakfast?! She walked away and I had tears about to come so I just got up and walked out and let my husband and toddler finish up. \nI do not believe I was wrong but even if I was, I felt they handled it very unprofessionally. 2 people coming at me, to the point I cry?! That's ridiculous. \nVery disappointed with the service. \nOh and don't worry, they put it in a to go box bc I asked them to since we had been there too long and my husband had to work. No hash browns and food still all piled and cold.",

Also factor in that Willa Jean is the brainchild of celebrity Chef John Besh, Chef Kelly Fields and Chef Lisa White so people know she's from a good southern family.\n\nWhen we got there all the tables were occupied but we slipped in at the countertop in the front window.  Our picks from the brunch menu were fresh juice, Griddled Banana Bread, Crawfish & Grits and BBQ Shrimp Toast.\n\nGRIDDLED BANANA BREAD\nI was not ready for this banana bread!  They paired two hunks of nut-free bread with a silky butter and every mouthful was so satisfying.  The bread was perfectly baked with a moist crumb and almost caramelized edges.  I always say you can tell how good a movie is going to be by watching the previews and you can usually tell how good the entrée will be on the strength of the starter.  The second I tasted the banana bread, I knew good things were in store for our entrées.\n\nWILLA JEAN CRAWFISH & GRITS\nFor the first few enjoyable bites, this dish was essentially crawfish etouffee (crawfish tails smothered in gravy) over grits with mini cheddar biscuits.  Then I dug in for another bite and my fork hit the slow cooked egg hidden inside.  It popped, oozing yolk everywhere and since undercooked eggs gross me out I couldn't deal.  (My guy was happy to take it off my hands.)  I know like 99.9% of Earth's population loves runny eggs but for the rest of us...know that \"slow cooked egg\" is code for a bursting, oozing egg.\n\nBBQ SHRIMP TOAST\nTheir version of NOLA BBQ shrimp was profoundly delicious.  The unmistakable fresh-from-the-sea flavor of Gulf shrimp...the crisp sourdough topped with bubbling burrata...a savory sauce for sopping.  I've never had cheese in a BBQ shrimp dish before but now that I've tasted it how can I enjoy other versions again?!?  Just thinking about the flavors again is making my mouth water.\n\nOur perch in the window was good for people watching and the service was brisk.  I didn't enjoy the egg surprise in the Crawfish & Grits but I really loved everything else.  So glad we found our way here and I can't wait to come back.",

The Caesar was crap.

And it starts the moment you walk in. I've experienced everything from being heavily pressured to schedule my next appointment immediately after I finished, to having a tech talk up several products during my appointment, and then grab them all and put them on the counter with the bill when I went to pay, as if I had already agreed to buy them. Very uncomfortable.\n\nThis is not the place to come if you're expecting a relaxing experience. They make no effort to hide the fact that they're basically just trying to get clients in and out as soon as possible. This means that if you're getting a brazilian, you'd better not be shy, because not only will you not get a towel to cover anything, but the tech will also expect you to \"prepare\" while she's in the room.\n\nI'm sure this is true for every salon, but the quality of the techs varies a LOT here.

Bar / lounge area looks like a nice place for some piano music and cocktails. \n\nThe food. The \"Surf & Turf\" I could order every time. Scallops...braised short ribs...gremolata. Something I wouldn't be able to repeat at home, which I'll always give props for. Tried the ocean roll  for sushi to have as an app with the surf and turf. Tasted good. Definitely presented well. But different in a way from a full on sushi place. I think the rice might not have been so sticky. \n\nLobster bisque soup tasted great. Hot and assembled at table side. Bread was good for snacking before everything came. My entree was the Chilean Sea Bass. I can't pass up on sea bass. Flakey, buttery, seasoned well. Potatoes and sauce all blended well with those buttery flakey bites of sea bass just cooked right. \n\nFlorida grouper entree was really good. Our guest finished his plate. Assembled well again. Sea scallop entree was very tasty and surprisingly a large portion.  To finish, the recommended warm butter cake by our server did not disappoint. Probably better than most dessert/pastry dishes I've tried out there at a restaurant.\n\nTo end, great food executed well and wonderful service. Hope to come back again soon. Worth it for the price.",

A friend and I went in for a late lunch and it was almost empty, it's spacious however. I ordered my usual, an Al Pastor Torta. It was huge, tasty, the meat ratio was just right and the pork super tasty. The hot sauce,  from a sauce bar, was the red variety. It's smokey delicious with a kick made this trip worthwhile.  My friend had a Carne Asado burrito. She devoured it in good order. It was big, fresh and meaty. One of my judging criteria for more authentic Mexican food is availability of Horchata, check. My only criticism and reason for only three stars is, dated, stale facilities. Value overrides this factor. Two meals, 2 drinks under $18.",

Very poor customer service skills. She had no patience at all and then hung up on me and I tried to call the place back and she wouldn't answer. I will never go back nor order from there again. Now I know why they have only three stars, partially customer service skills. It's okay DIM SUM GARDEN is better tha. This place anyway.",
